Scott Chivers, who goes by the name of Ratarossa on YouTube, was given exclusive access to the 'car graveyard' by the owner of the property.
The collection of old motors included stone cold classics such as a Jensen Healey, a TR6, Golf GTI mk 1 and a few old Jags.

It is fun that you pointed out the tail lights, the most desirable 2002's were the "Roundies" which for the 2002tii was only the model years 1971, 1972, and 1973."</p><p>And another fan posted: "That was an amazing walk. The volume of cool cars was surreal. It killed me that you flashed one car on camera and never went near it again.</p><p>"Out of all of those cars, the one I would take got like .5 seconds of screen time. The orange Opel Kadett Rallye with the black hood stripes! I want to see it."</p><p>A car enthusiast said: "And I've taken on 3 similarly abandoned projects. One was an old Ducati so a fraction of the work.</p><p>"They are the hardest to come to terms with selling. I never go the money back that I put in, but those 3 vehicles are now in the hands of true enthusiasts, so I feel I did my part for motoring history keeping them alive."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/491c283c-47e9-4b9a-bf19-764589982e17.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/25d6b9a4-650c-4548-ac29-60838130d96d.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/a4d6e643-b42b-4e86-bbac-060da3608e86.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgJFwbmxvZGSuo63NnaannZRisK2t0qygnGWTlr9us9GarZ6xkaexbrnAp6qip55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zach-sudfeld.html><span>←</span><span>Zach Sudfeld</span></a>
