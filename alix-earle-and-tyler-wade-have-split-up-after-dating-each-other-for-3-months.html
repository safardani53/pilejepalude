<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Alix Earle And Tyler Wade Have Split Up After Dating Each Other For 3 Months</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Alix Earle</strong>, a TikTok celebrity from New Jersey, acknowledged her split with professional baseball player Tyler Wade. Alix and Tyler began dating in September of this year, and the athlete has starred in many of Earle’s films. Fans, however, observed his unexpected departure from Alix Earle’s social media profile, sparking suspicion about their breakup.</p><p>Earle has about two million TikTok followers. Her work includes vlogs on her time at the University of Miami. She is now pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing. Her most famous videos are about her getting ready, titled “Get Ready With Me,” in which she applies her makeup and dresses for the day.&nbsp;Wade, 28, is a professional baseball utility player for the Oakland Athletics of the American League. Tyler made his Major League Baseball debut in 2017 with the New York Yankees. In 2022, he also played for the Los Angeles Angels.</p><p>Alix uploaded images with Tyler on her Instagram page in addition to appearing on her TikToks. Fans noticed that the photographs and videos vanished from her page, as had any fresh updates concerning the pair. Earle’s admirers also noted that, although she often shares images with her boyfriend on social media, Tyler seldom shared anything about Alix. They just formalized their relationship in September.</p><h2>Tyler, according to Alix Earle, never uploaded her images on his social media accounts, even when they took wonderful pictures together.</h2><p>Alix conducted a TikTok Live in which she claimed that she and Wade had called it quits because they were fighting and she was upset. Alix detailed the reasons for her three-month breakup with her partner on TikTok Live. She stated:</p><p>“We haven’t been together in a long time. I’ve simply been keeping it from you because I didn’t want to deal with it right now. Even the photos I shared of myself and my lover were taken just a week or two ago.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alix-Earle-3.jpg alt="Alix Earle" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Alix also expressed her disappointment that Tyler refused to upload any images of her on his Instagram or other social media accounts. Tyler didn’t post anything despite taking some nice shots together at a wedding.&nbsp;Alix Earle, on the other hand, seemed to have moved on from the separation. She recently released a video of herself on an aircraft, eating a luxury dinner while holding a drink, and adding a sound that said:</p><p>“Damn, you guys split up?”</p><p>As a result, another background sound was added that said:</p><p>“No, she shattered – I’m up.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alix-Earle-4.jpg alt="Alix Earle" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While sipping her drink, Alix relaxed to the music. Fans on social media praised her demeanor. Alix Earle’s confident single lady vibe is winning her followers, who believe she will be the next ‘It girl’ on TikTok and that 2023 will be her year. Her celebrity has surely risen as a result of her divorce from MLB player Tyler Wade.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYpaGoYrKivsueZJqmlGLBurjEq2SwmZSaeqmt1Z5krKicnsFuwc9mmJ%2Bslad6pa3ToqWgZZWWsKl5zq2fnqpdm7yzeZJmpKimpJ3AcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./winter-house-casts-dating-history-craig-ciara-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Winter House Casts Dating History: Craig, Ciara and More</span></a>
