"Mom is kinetic and she is a butterfly, and Pa likes his family and his home. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>But when they're together, it's so powerful</a>," she told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE's 2020 Beautiful Issue</a>, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Almost Famous</a> star opened up about modeling her mom's parenting style, especially regarding raising her daughter. "Mom was so available to being my greatest cheerleader," Kate told PEOPLE. "It just made me think about Rani — I just hope I give her that kind of confidence."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As a parent, you basically raise your children to raise their children appropriately as well. So that's that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>domino effect</a>," Goldie told PEOPLE in March 2022. "And as parents, we have a tremendous responsibility."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Mother's Day in May 2023, Kate gave Goldie a sweet shout-out on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Remember when we only had a couple tries to get a good pic? I really love those days. My Mama didn't wait around to get the perfect pic. In fact she has few pics of all of us together because she let us run around and be in the moment," she captioned a throwback photo of herself with Goldie, Oliver and baby Boston.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Bride Wars star continued: "The ones she does are always a little silly, a little blurry, half smiles, half cries, chocolate faces and unbrushed hair. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>She gave us freedom</a>, let us be wild, loved us endlessly and we got the pictures to prove it. I love you Mama."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn's children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-oliver-hudson-47></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Oliver Hudson, 47</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Desiree Navarro/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goldie welcomed son Oliver with ex-husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bill Hudson</a> on Sept. 7, 1976. Oliver gained TV recognition for his roles on Rules of Engagement, Nashville, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Scream Queens</a> and The Cleaning Lady. He's also famously known for hosting the podcast Sibling Revelry with younger sister Kate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Per Kate, Oliver is quite the jokester, too. "He really is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>funnier than me</a>," she told PEOPLE in 2021. That same year, Oliver was featured in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>PEOPLE's 2021 Sexiest Man Alive issue</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oliver <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>married his wife, Erinn Barlett, in 2006</a>, though, he recalls Goldie's motherly push to get him down on one knee. "To be honest, it was not easy. I didn't want to get married. I thought that the perfect relationship was Kurt and Mom," Oliver said on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>E!'s Daily Pop</a> in 2022. "I mean, I was a child of divorce, that didn't work, and then I saw this working."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Referring to his proposal as "a major surprise," Oliver remembered Erinn telling her parents that a wedding was more than likely not in the cards. After a heartfelt conversation with his mom, Oliver knew it was the right choice: "She says, 'It's [the ring] a token. You don't have to get married right away.' And so I gave [Erinn] the ring and it was very scary and we were engaged for two and a half years."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Goldie Hawn Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oliver and Erinn are parents to sons <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Wilder Brooks</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bodhi Hawn</a> and daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Rio Laura</a>.

"I mean, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he's such a gift</a>. They're all gifts, all my children."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kate-hudson-44></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kate Hudson, 44</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Daniele Venturelli/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goldie and Bill's daughter Kate was born on April 19, 1979. The 2000 film Almost Famous made Kate (who starred as Penny Lane) an overnight sensation, earning her a Golden Globe for best supporting actress. Her career continued to skyrocket with films such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a> (2003), Fool's Gold (2008), <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bride Wars</a> (2009) and Something Borrowed (2011).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate has always praised her mother and Kurt, who helped raise Kate alongside Goldie. In honor of Kurt's 70th birthday, Kate penned a heartfelt letter reexamining "how different our life would have been if he never entered the picture."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's an original. One of kind. A powerful, intelligent, talented, loyal family man. He has taught me that we can all exist with immense love through our differences," she wrote on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He gave me the gift of confidence, instilling a knowingness in me that I deserved everything I worked for and I knew that he'd always have my back in whatever challenges may lay ahead. When you have a dad who gives you permission to be confident, you live courageously," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate is a mom of three herself. She welcomed her son Ryder Robinson with ex-husband Chris Robinson in January 2004. She also shares a son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bingham Hawn Bellamy</a>, who was born in 2011, with ex-fiancé Matt Bellamy. In 2018, Kate and her fiancé <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Danny Fujikawa</a> welcomed daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Goldie Hawn and Kate Hudson in 2017.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to navigating the ins and outs of co-parenting, Kate says she's learned from the best. "I think the one thing that I learned from my mom is that no matter what you're feeling and no matter what — when I see my friends talking s--- about their ex-spouses in front of their kids, I get so upset because they don't recognize how much that affects their child and how resentful their child will become of them," the Fabletics founder said on a 2019 episode of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Divorce Sucks! With Laura Wasser podcast</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"No matter what, I never heard a bad word about my father," she said, adding, "It's not our place to tell them [kids] how to feel about the other parents. I think that's so important."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the actress wouldn't "recommend it [her situation] to most," she believes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the relationships she's formed with each of her kids' fathers</a> are "quite amazing," — even more amazing is the fact that the dads all get along as well!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We might not have been able to live together and sustain the distance, but at the end of the day, there's real love there. When the kids feel that I think, to them, it makes them feel safe and good," Kate said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-boston-russell-43></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Boston Russell, 43</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Boston Russell, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Kate Hudson in 2017.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Granitz/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on Feb. 16, 1980, Boston is Kurt's son whom he shares with actress and ex-wife Season Hubley. The pair met on the set of 1979's Elvis, in which they portrayed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elvis</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Priscilla Presley</a>. Their divorce came four years later, in 1983. Apart from the occasional red carpet appearance, Boston lives an ultra-private life, out of the spotlight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate, however, remembers the first time she met Boston as a young girl. "For me, it felt like such a big moment because it was like, 'My mom is madly in love with this guy.' For me, at the time, it was like, 'Is this going to be my dad?' " she recalled on her podcast Sibling Revelry. "And I was meeting his son [Boston], which meant, 'Does this mean that this is my brother?' It was a lot to handle at such a young age."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wyatt-russell-37></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wyatt Russell, 37</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>The Walt Disney Company</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kurt and Goldie welcomed their son Wyatt Russell on July 10, 1986. Wyatt Russell rose to comedic fame after starring in 22 Jump Street (2014) and Table 19 (2017); however, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Disney</a>'s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a> cemented Wyatt into TV stardom in 2021.

They <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wed in a Western-themed wedding</a> in September 2019 at Goldie's house in Aspen, Colorado.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their family expanded in March 2021 with the arrival of their son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Buddy Prine Russell</a>.
