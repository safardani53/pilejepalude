I thank God every day for choosing you to be my mom.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kris’ admiration and appreciation for MJ is deeply shared by the entire Kardashian/Jenner family, who frequently express their love for their “most wonderful grandmother” on social media and in real-life moments captured on their reality TV shows over the years. She even stepped up as one of the only two witnesses for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kourtney Kardashian</a>’s courthouse marriage to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Travis Barker</a> in May 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who is MJ Shannon? From her short-lived first marriage to the advice she’s dolled out to her daughter and granddaughters over the years, here’s everything to know about Kris Jenner’s mom.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-her-first-marriage-only-lasted-2-months></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Her first marriage only lasted 2 months</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mary Jo "MJ" Shannon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kris Jenner Instagram&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born in Arkansas on July 26, 1934, MJ was a model in her youth and married her high school sweetheart (who also happened to be her first kiss!) at age 18. While they’d dated for 4 years, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the union only lasted two months</a> after tying the knot, much like her granddaughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kim Kardashian</a>. (Kim famously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>tied the knot with NBA star Kris Humphries</a> for 72 days in 2011.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We have a lot in common. We both got married for two months once,” Kim said to MJ during a candid chat that was posted to the SKIMS founder’s website and app in December 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We have so much in common. History repeats itself,” MJ agreed. “I can’t believe it because I was married for two months at 18. Right out of high school I was given an engagement ring, a guy I had been going with for four years,” MJ said. “And then I just thought, ‘You know what? This isn’t really that much fun,’ so I got out of it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Once you got married you realized it. ‘What did I do?’ And you try to stay in there for a month or so and really try hard and you just can’t,” MJ continued. “You think, ‘I shouldn’t waste his time.’ ” she explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kim was quick to concur. “Yes! I get it, Grandma. I feel you.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-went-on-to-marry-two-more-times></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She went on to marry two more times</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kris Jenner and her mother, Mary Jo "MJ" Shannon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kris Jenner Instagram&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soon after splitting from her first husband, MJ wed Robert Houhgton, with whom she welcomed daughter Kris at age 20, and another daughter, Karen Houghton, shortly afterwards. Their marriage was also short lived; they divorced in 1962, when Kris was 7 years old. MJ then raised Kris and her sister Karen on her own before meeting and marrying her third husband, Harry Shannon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MJ and Harry’s union lasted for 40 years, up until his death after a car crash in 2003. Kris considered him to be a father figure, previously referring to him as “my dad” in a 2015 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Haute Living</a> profile and acknowledging that his death “was so devastating for my family.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-owned-a-childrens-clothing-store-for-decades></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She owned a children’s clothing store for decades</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mary Jo "MJ" Shannon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kris Jenner Instagram&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kris’ entrepreneurial spirit traces back to her mom, who opened up a now-shuttered children’s boutique called Shannon & Company in 1980. MJ helmed the La Jolla, California, store for decades, with Kris even pitching in during her teenage years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I used to work there when I was young. My dad was in a car accident in 2003, and when he was in the hospital, my mom wanted to close the store, but I said I would run it for her,” Kris told Haute Living. While Harry recovered over the next 14 weeks, she drove back and forth to the store from her home in San Diego every day. “I was exhausted trying to make it all work from San Diego, but I knew my mom and dad needed me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadly, Harry died from complications of the accident soon after. Kris then decided to open her own children’s store, following in her mother’s footsteps. “I knew I had to find something to throw myself into that I was good at,” she explained, adding that Kourtney helped her to run the store, which was the first of the family’s boutique empire that later became the original focus of their reality show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MJ’s grandchildren spent plenty of time in the store throughout their youth as well, she revealed to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Beast</a>. “They grew up playing in the store,” she said, adding, “I recall Kim sitting on this very floor and counting money. She would sing, ‘Counting is the game, and money is my name,’ or ‘Money is my name and counting is the game.’ Something like that.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-made-a-few-forays-into-the-spotlight></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She’s made a few forays into the spotlight</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kris Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, MJ Shannon, and Khloe Kardashian.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Khloe Kardashian Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MJ has been one of KUWTK’s most beloved guest stars over the years, appearing on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>several memorable episodes</a>. Perhaps her most famous cameo is when she convinces Kris to take weed gummies with her, and the mother-daughter duo end up giggling as they eat popcorn on the couch together. She inadvertently makes Kris cry in another episode, during which Kris interviews her mother in order to create a video tribute to MJ’s legacy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MJ has also joined her family for other major public events, including on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Celebrity Family Feud in 2018</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While MJ herself doesn’t have a public-facing profile on social media, she’s managed to “keep up” with her famous family <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thanks to a private Instagram account</a>. "My grandma has a creep IG account to see what we're all up to," Kim shared on Instagram, revealing the “fun fact” about her grandmother in a caption alongside a since-deleted photo of herself, Kris, and MJ coordinating in cream-colored tops and matching blonde hairstyles.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-survived-cancer-twice></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She’s survived cancer twice</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Khloe Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, MJ Shannon, and Kourtney Kardashian.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kris Jenner Instagram&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, MJ has battled both breast and colon cancer, Kim revealed on an episode of KUWTK.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When she had cancer, the radiation shrunk her intestines, so once a year she had these crazy fits where she would be throwing up all night and literally think she was gonna die,” Kim told her sisters. Noting that MJ survived cancer twice, she added that her grandmother had been feeling “sicker and sicker” lately, and that she wanted to ensure the family joined together to spend some quality time with the matriarch while she was feeling down.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-was-one-of-two-witnesses-at-kourtneys-wedding></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She was one of two witnesses at Kourtney’s wedding</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>MJ Shannon, Kourtney Kardashian, Travis Barker, and Randy Barker.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kris Jenner Instagram&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When granddaughter Kourtney Kardashian <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tied the knot with Travis Barker in May 2022</a>, MJ was one of two witnesses present for the official courthouse nuptials in Santa Monica. She was the only representative from the Kardashian/Jenner family, as the other witness was Travis’ dad, Randy Barker; the Poosh founder and Blink-182 drummer decided to hold one of their three ceremonies closer to home for the two of them, as neither was able to travel abroad to their lavish wedding in Italy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kourtney reminisced on the special moment later that summer while wishing MJ a happy birthday. Alongside photos from the special day, she wrote, "My special, sweet, chic, sophisticated, smart and most wonderful grandmother. Happy birthday my MJ ❤.” She continued, "So happy you could be one of the only two guests we had when we were legally married, I will always remember this day and night with you."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-supportive-of-her-grandkids-embracing-their-sensuality></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She’s supportive of her grandkids embracing their sensuality</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kim Kardashian and her grandmother, MJ Shannon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kim Kardashian Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MJ may dress a bit more modestly these days, but she’s all in favor of her granddaughters wearing whatever suits them (including nothing at all).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think you like to be nude, all you guys," MJ told Kim on an episode of KUWTK. "And half the people on the internet. I think it's a thing now,” she said. “I don't got it, so I don't flaunt it,” she joked of her current style, noting that she didn’t always feel that way — back in her youth, her typical uniform was a bikini.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I always wore a bikini when I was younger. Even at home, I'd be dusting with an apron on and I'd have a bikini,” she said. “So I always liked to be free."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond her apparel choices, MJ has long been a free spirit in terms of sensuality as well. Kim recalled some special advice that she’d once shared with her about the most luxurious places to get intimate — and how she’d <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>recently acted on MJ’s words of wisdom</a> with then-boyfriend Pete Davidson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You know what's so crazy?" Kim asked her grandmother on an episode of The Kardashians. "Pete and I were staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel last weekend, and we were sitting in front of the fireplace, just talking for hours, and I was like, 'My grandma told me that you really live life when you have sex in front of the fireplace,' and so we had sex in front of the fireplace in honor of you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MJ was quick to clarify some details about the story, expressing concern that Kim had opted to have intercourse in the hotel lobby. “Not in the lobby!” Kim exclaimed.&nbsp; "But how creepy to think about your grandma before you have sex?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MJ wasn't fazed by the awkward discussion. "I know, but I was younger once.

The red, script tattoo reads “Mary Jo” —&nbsp;her “grandmothers name in my grandfathers handwriting,” she explained in the caption at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kim has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gushed over her appreciation for MJ</a> in various birthday messages, expressing her gratitude for all the lessons she’s learned from her. “You are the woman who taught me my work ethic and have taught me so much about life, love and relationships," Kim wrote to celebrate her 87th birthday in 2021, adding that she can always rely on MJ to “keep it all the way real with me!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her 88th birthday, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kris wrote a thoughtful note</a> to her “very beautiful mommy,” sharing a slideshow of photos of the duo and calling MJ “my best friend, my heart and my hero.” Most recently, Khloe called her grandmother “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a keeper of secrets and a storyteller</a> like no other,” adding that she could listen to her tell stories forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW6twaisrWWdn3q0tMCnpaimXaC%2Fqr%2BMo5ynppWneq67zGZucWhmZX93</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alan-muraoka.html><span>←</span><span>Alan Muraoka</span></a>
