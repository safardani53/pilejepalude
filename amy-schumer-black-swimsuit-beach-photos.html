Jane, who do we want to thank?” she asked. Jane replied, “Thanks for the people who are watching our show, thanks for all the support and love. Thank you Food Network, thanks to Amy especially and Chris, and this little guy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5FwZpqlqWLApLTUppyrZZKhrqS3jKyuoqWjqra1ecGemJygXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alessa-quizon.html><span>←</span><span>Alessa Quizon</span></a>
