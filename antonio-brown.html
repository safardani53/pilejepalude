The duo gave birth to him while they were having an adamant time.</p><p>Antonio’s Father, Eddie, was still very young when Antonio was born. He was in a struggling phase, and his professional career had just started. So, the economic condition of the family was not very strong.</p><p>Soon after, his younger brother Desmond was born. Meanwhile, his Father’s relationship with his mother was not so good, and after frequent quarrels and fights, the couple eventually separated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Antonio-Brown-with-his-father-Eddie-Brown.jpg><p>Growing up in Liberty City, Miami, he joined Miami Norland Senior High School. He became interested in playing football from an early age.</p><p>Moreover, his mother had difficulty raising two sons independently and remarried.

In addition, he did various odd jobs to sustain himself and keep moving forward.</p><p>After his high school years, he joined Central Michigan University to play college football, where he achieved so much; after that, he never looked back.</p><p>However, he redeveloped his relationship with his mother and biological Father over time.

Following this, he used Alcorn State but to no avail.</p><p>Then, he enrolled in North Carolina Tech Prep and played there for a season before moving to Florida International University.</p><p>Sadly, he lost his scholarship even before the season started for misbehaving with the University’s security staff.</p><p>Eventually, he joined Central Michigan University and began playing football under the tutelage of Butch Jones.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Brown played college football at Central Michigan University for around three years. Soon after, the college offered him a scholarship, and he began playing mainly as a wide receiver, contrary to being a quarterback during high school.</p><p>Even though he struggled to adjust to college life and attend training and practice sessions on time.</p><p>However, coach Zach Azzani, recognizing his potential, behaved with him as his kid and helped him with his game.</p><p>Antonio played well enough to receive numerous awards and honors in his first year.
