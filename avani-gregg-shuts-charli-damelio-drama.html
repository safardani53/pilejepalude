She did not address if there were any drama between her and Gregg but indicated that they were still friends.</p><p>Regardless, some people were still not convinced, so Gregg took it upon herself to remind people that she and D’Amelio were still friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Avani Gregg still friends with Charli D’Amelio?</h2><p>As said before, neither Gregg nor D’Amelio has addressed if they have any feud or beef going on. However, it seems like everything is fine between the pair.</p><p>On March 2, 2023, D’Amelio posted a series of photos with the caption, “i don’t know.” The photos were random —&nbsp; some included her selfies,&nbsp; childhood photos, mirror selfies, pictures of her shoes, and the view, among others.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>One of the pictures was of her boyfriend, <a href=#>Landon Barker</a>, lying on the dog bed while using his phone, whereas, Rebel, D’Amelio’s dog, was sleeping on the couch.</p><p>Gregg liked the post and then commented, “landon laying in the dog bed and rebel on the couch is the best thing.” Soon after Gregg commented that people started believing that the two are still friends and have no feud between the two.</p><p>Before Gregg, D’Amelio debunked the rumors of a beef between them.

(Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>)</p><p>The toy was gifted by Gregg and D’Amelio carried it around with her when she went on vacations. She mentioned in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Self</a>, how much the toy meant to her.&nbsp;</p><p>“I try to take it on every vacation or travel destination I go to, but I mostly like it for when I’m home by myself and Rebel, my dog, isn’t at the house,” she revealed.</p><p>D’Amelio did not write anything on her Instagram Stories, but the notion of her posting the gift that meant a lot to him proved that there was no beef between Gregg and her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Madi Monroe chimes in</h2><p>Initially, the rumors of a feud started after Gregg posted some cryptic videos on her TikTok. Both Gregg and D’Amelio were in Milan for the fashion week, of 2023, but there was no indication that the two were hanging out.</p><p>For best friends, who were like two peas in a pod, it was weird for their fans and followers to see that. Soon, netizens presumed that they had drifted apart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Moreover, Gregg posted a <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> of her drinking wine with the caption, “when in Milan.” While it seemed like a normal video, her fans and followers noticed the sound used by TikToker.</p><p>It was the song ‘Fair Trade,’ by Drake, and the lyrics read, “I been losin’ friends and findin’ peace / But honestly, that sounds like a fair trade to me.”</p><p>To make matters worse, Madi Monroe, commented ‘thank god,’ on the post. Monroe and D’Amelio had a beef, and the two were no longer on talking terms.</p><p>Monroe had tweeted some cryptic messages hinting that D’Amelio was only hanging out with her to get together with Chase Hudson. Later, she clarified that she did not shade D’Amelio, but the damage had been done.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Soon, they drifted apart. <a href=#>D’Amelio told BFF Podcast</a>, that the two had good memories together but were no longer friends.</p><p>However, it seems like they have mended things between them because D’Amelio, along with her parents and sister, <a href=#>sent flowers to Monore</a> on her birthday.</p><p>Similarly, the two also started following each other on Instagram. Therefore, it is unknown who Monroe was thinking about when she commented on Gregg’s TikTok.</p><p>Moreover, since both Gregg and D’Amelio clarified that they were still friends, it seems like the rumored drama between the duo was blown out of proportion.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme8CvmKehXZy%2FprPGZqqhraSoeqS0wKujomWUlrqmuMioZJ2qkaKucA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-debuts-second-hunger-games-single-in-concert.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Debuts Second Hunger Games Single in Concert</span></a>
