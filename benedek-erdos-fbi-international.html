This creates a layered dynamic of constant pining as well opportunities to explore other storylines plot wise.</p><p>This obviously doesn't mean that Kellett is going to sit there and be sad. Oh, no sir. In fact, Kellett already has a new man in the form of one very handsome <a href=#>Hungarian lieutenant</a>, Benedek Erdős, played by Miklós Bányai.</p><p>Let's see what we can find out about this new man in Kellett's life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who Is Benedek Erdős on ‘FBI International’?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Benedek Erdős is Jamie Kellet's new love interest in Season 2 of <a href=#>FBI:International.</a> He is a Hungarian lieutenant who first appeared in Episode 13 when Kellett trained some of the police officers in Budapest, accidentally injuring "Ben," as he told Kellett to call him. Ben then ended up helping the FBI with a case.</p><p>Benedek Erdős is played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miklós Bányai,</a> a Hungarian actor. Miklós was born on March 10, 1985, and he studied at the University of Kaposvar in Kaposvar, Hungary.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miklós</a> is a well-known actor in Hungary, starring in projects like Hazatalálsz and Land of the Brave, although you may recognize him from his role of Szabó in Dracula.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Miklós Bányai (@miklosbanyai)</a></p></figure><p>Miklós also stars in the Estonia film Free Money, that, "tells three loosely interconnected stories about money, cryptocurrency and the investment culture of the last few years when investing has become a form of entertainment, and ordinary folk are trading in stocks and coins," according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Benedek Erdős' relationship with Kellett on show?</h2><p>As stated above, Ben met Kellett when she was teaching some of the Hungarian police department fighting technique, accidentally breaking his arm in the process... although he won't admit it. Ben and Kellett meet up again to work on a case together, getting closer and closer to each other, until they eventually start dating.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>However, this relationship seems to take a turn on the episode airing on March 14, as the promo for the episode has Ben icing people out with Kellett saying, "You think the man I'm seeing is a cold blooded killer?" before being seemingly being abducted by him.</p><p>Kellett seemed to like Ben because of how easy the relationship felt, especially after Forrester. But it appears things only got more complicated. Fingers crossed Kellet has many more seasons of FBI: International to figure it out.</p><p>Make sure you catch FBI: International every Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET/ 8 p.m. CT on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KvscOeomadopm8tHnFm6BmoZ6psrO6wK2gqKaRoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wade-desarmo.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Wade DesArmo net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
