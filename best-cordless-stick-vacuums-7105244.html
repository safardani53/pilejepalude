While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>corded upright vacuums</a> are powerful and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>robot vacuums</a> are convenient, cordless stick vacuums are the best of both worlds. These cord-free cleaning gadgets can be used anywhere in the home, on virtually every surface, and thanks to the slim design, they are a breeze to carry around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Cordless stick vacuums are perfect for getting those hard-to-reach spots, such as under couches, tables, beds, or really any kind of furniture," says cleaning expert Hailey Becnel. "The possibilities are endless." Becnel recommends getting a lightweight cordless stick vac with excellent suction power and a long battery life — extra points if it has a HEPA filter to capture indoor allergens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We've tested over 100 vacuums of all types, but we honed in on 15 top-rated cordless stick vacuums to test for this piece. We put them through obstacle courses, measured their noise output, and watched as they picked up coffee grounds, pet hair, cereal, and more. After that, we took the 8 winning vacuums home and tested them in our spaces for three months. Discover which ones were powerful, easy to use, and a breeze to maneuver. We promise: Once you feel how easy using a cordless stick vacuum is, you'll never want to touch an upright again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are the best cordless stick vacuums PEOPLE Tested.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-eufy-by-anker-homevac-h30-infinity-cordless-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>eufy by Anker HomeVac H30 Infinity</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="eufy by Anker HomeVac H30 Infinity Cordless Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7DJTk6z_8ZYhI9DQHoJj16csOKk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eufy-by-anker-homevac-h30-infinity-cordless-handheld-vacuum-cleaner-701203ba1feb410b9f0e9702616f8a11.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li><p>Incredible suction power</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Transitioned seamlessly from hardwood floor to carpet</p></li><li readability=0><p>At only two pounds, it's the lightest cordless vac we tested</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Excellent value; it's nearly half the price of similar top-performing stick vacuums</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Transitions into a handheld vac with ease</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>Loud compared to other vacuums on the list</p></li><li readability=0><p>Small dust bin, so you may need to empty it several times if you're cleaning a large area</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Eufy HomeVac H30 Infinity stood out from the moment we saw it. We don't think it's possible to underestimate how fantastic this vacuum is compared to its relatively low price tag. Just unboxing this cordless vacuum was a pleasurable experience, not unlike opening a brand-new computer. Not only that, but connecting the parts was a fun and easy process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, this cordless stick vacuum did an excellent job sucking up hair, coffee grounds, and popcorn kernels. Though it struggled a bit to pick up Cheerios from carpet, there was no issue on hard floors. Other than the Cheerios, the compact design worked incredibly well cleaning up messes on both medium- and high-pile carpet, and there's virtually no user effort in transitioning it from one surface to another.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The HomeVac H30 lasts for about 20 minutes on medium power and roughly nine minutes on high. The suction is really strong, considering the compact, lightweight design. (It weighs less than 2 pounds.) However, we found it extremely loud, so it might disrupt others while you're using it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another thing to note is that the dust bin is pretty small, so we had to empty it multiple times to get through our tests. While the debris slid out without creating a mess, releasing the lid should have been easier. All things considered, we think the price is more than fair and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to just about anyone in the market for a stick vacuum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We've been testing this Eufy cordless vacuum at home for three months and are still so impressed by this lightweight power machine. Thanks to its thin design, it's so easy to use; it can get into crevices and corners so much easier than other vacuums we've tested. We've also been impressed with the battery life. It holds a charge well and hasn't lost suction power over the past three months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>16.5 x 3.5 x 3 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>1.8 pounds | <strong>Canister Size:</strong> 0.25 liters | <strong>Battery Life: </strong>21 minutes | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Pet brush, crevice tool, pipe, mop head</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-belife-v12-cordless-vacuum-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Belife Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Belife BVC12 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/p3G5t7cIwIxuE3aG2-PNWZhXnZA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/belife-bvc12-cordless-vacuum-cleaner-7817e4fd93a046e3b28fa6cf16f0bdb4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>Effective on hard floors, grout, and medium- and high-pile carpet</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Battery lasted almost an hour during testing</p></li><li readability=-1><p>HEPA filter helps trap small particles</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On a budget? Go with the Belife BVC12. This vacuum took just five minutes to set up, thanks to the straightforward instructions and pre-assembled design. It did an excellent job picking up messes on hard floors, grout, and medium- and high-pile carpet, though it seemed to perform a little better on carpets when sucking up larger pieces, like stuck-together Cheerios. With a built-in HEPA filter, it also helps remove dust, pollen, and other allergens from your indoor air.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This vacuum moved around tight corners and reached small areas like a champ. It ran for a whopping 53 minutes on regular suction power and 13 minutes on high before needing to be recharged. The noise wasn't particularly disruptive, either — you can definitely hold a conversation while it's running. The only real downside is that the brush attachment wasn't very useful — hair kept getting stuck in the bristles — but it's hard to beat the affordable price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After testing this vacuum for three months at home, we see why it's a budget pick, but we'd still recommend it for a starter vacuum. At home, we felt we needed to use it on its highest setting for maximum effectiveness, so the battery didn't last quite as long as it did when lab testing. However, if you're looking for an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>under-$200 vacuum</a>, it's still super easy to maneuver and a great value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>43.5 x 9.5 x 9 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>5.3 pounds | <strong>Canister Size:</strong> 0.7 liters | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 53 minutes | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Crevice tool, upholstery brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-runner-up-innova-cordless-stick-multi-surface-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Runner-Up</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Innova Cordless Stick Multi-Surface Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Eureka Innova Cordless Stick Vacuum " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SU-7pTwGIcnkU_kf4Vk6xNl67Co=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eureka-innova-cordless-stick-vacuum-dfd9ff841ec74b75a2f73b7bc92a95e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Easy setup; would make a great starter vacuum</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Long battery life compared to other stick vacs we tested</p></li><li readability=0><p>Large, easy-to-empty dust bin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Eureka Innova was a close second to the HomeVac H30. Once we had all the pieces unwrapped, this vacuum was super easy to set up. Rather than a high and low power mode, the settings are based on floor type (hard surfaces or carpet). Though it picked up all the debris on both surfaces, it wasn't as efficient on high-pile carpet without using the crevice tool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Innova ran for about 24 minutes before needing to be recharged, and the power held strong the entire time. The noise level wasn't particularly quiet but not disruptive either. At just over 8 pounds, it's a little heavier than most stick vacs, though it wasn't overly cumbersome. The dirt canister was not only generously sized but also easy to empty. In the end, we think the price is right on point for a high-quality stick vacuum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>45.5 x 11 x 10 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>8.1 pounds | <strong>Canister Size:</strong> 1 liter | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 24 minutes | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Pet tool, crevice tool, upholstery brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-pet-owners-samsung-jet-75-cordless-stick-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Pet Owners</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Samsung Jet 75 Stick Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Samsung Jet 75 Cordless Stick Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/yVjMWVl4ydRA07C94LmbLD3OkTM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SamsungJet75CordlessStickVacuum-16324fb3ab074160adcf4e12d98e8b08.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Excellent suction power; picked up all messes with ease</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Captures pet dander with HEPA filter</p></li><li><p>Easy-to-empty dirt cup</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Super easy to maneuver around obstacles</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Complex setup</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have fur babies at home, you need a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pet hair vacuum</a> with extremely strong suction power to pick up all of those tiny hairs. "I am a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pet owner</a>, so I must have a vacuum that can get all that hair up," she says. Not only will the Samsung Jet 75 pick up pet fur and dirt, but it also has a built-in HEPA filter that promises to trap over 99.9% of pet dander and other allergens. This powerful stick vacuum did a great job picking up all the other debris, too, though we needed to use the crevice tool to suck up the popcorn kernels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Jet 75 has a low, medium, and high setting. It runs for 27 minutes on the lowest suction power and about 10 minutes on high. This vacuum is pretty loud on high but otherwise not too disruptive. It maneuvers well on different flooring surfaces and around corners. The dust bin is also easy to empty — everything came out with one shake — and it's conveniently washable. Aside from the steep price, one of the only drawbacks is that the setup process was a little confusing — it took us 23 minutes to put it together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>44.5 x 10 x 8.5 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>5.5 pounds | <strong>Canister Size:</strong> 0.8 liters | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 27 minutes | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Dust brush, pet hair tool, crevice tool</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-tineco-pure-one-s11-smart-stickhandheld-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tineco Pure One S11 Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tineco Pure One S11 Smart Stick/Handheld Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/PnF7aFhScpUT-E01FvPWTbXaLRQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TinecoPureOneS11TangoSmartVacuumCleaner-bcc3bc97057f4664a425736fcdbcf3be.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tineco</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>Powerful suction with quiet operation</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Lightweight and easy to maneuver</p></li><li readability=-1><p>One-handed dust bin emptying</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Smart screen lets you know when the floor is clean</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Battery lasted 30+ minutes during testing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're willing to spend a bit more in a high-quality vacuum, Tineco's Pure One S11 Tango won't disappoint. Aside from unwrapping all the attachments, it was really easy to set up. With powerful suction and handy attachments, this cordless stick vacuum had no problem quickly picking up most of the debris during our tests, save for the Cheerios. And it ran for over 30 minutes without needing to be recharged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Pure One was one of the quieter vacuums we tried — you can barely hear it through a wall. At under 6 pounds, this sleek cleaning companion is lightweight and easy to move around, transitioning smoothly from hard floors to carpet. We also like how the canister can be emptied one-handed. While some hair got tangled in the brush roll, it came out without a fuss using the included tool. The price is steeper than other cordless vacuums on our list, but considering the reliable, efficient design, we think it's well worth the investment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>43.5 x 10.5 x 8.5 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>5.8 pounds | <strong>Canister Size:</strong> 0.6 liters | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 31 minutes | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Mini brush, dust brush, crevice tool, hair tool</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-carpet-bissell-1984-air-ram-cordless-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Carpet</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bissell 1984 Air Ram Cordless Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bissell 1984 AirRam Cordless Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5lortaPurUy9qkwBMELk7YikKI4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bissell-1984-air-ram-cordless-vacuum--3882763f84fc4e149165eb801e5ee855.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Incredibly easy to set up (took about 6 minutes)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Works well on low- and high-pile carpet and transitions easily between all surfaces</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Very long battery life for a cordless vacuum</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For carpeted floors, we recommend the Bissell AirRam. The setup was straightforward and only took about six minutes. This cordless stick vacuum does excellent work on various flooring surfaces, including medium-pile carpet and even high-pile rugs. We didn't have to pick it up when transitioning between surfaces; it rolled flat to reach under furniture, and it even glided effortlessly along the edges of the carpet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The AirRam ran for 42 minutes (nearly twice as long as many other models we tested), and the power didn't wane at all before dying. It wasn't too noisy, either, and the dust bin emptied with the push of a button. One thing to note is that this vacuum doesn't come with any attachments. But we thought it worked just as well as a standard upright vacuum and think it's a great value, especially if you can find it on sale.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>44 x 12 x 10 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>7.2 pounds | <strong>Canister Size:</strong> 0.6 liters | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 42 minutes | <strong>Attachments:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hard-floors-dyson-omni-glide-cordless-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hard Floors</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Omni-Glide</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Omni-Glide+ Cordless Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BtlljFJ2AsQ5C-nN3BJoZ9PAbdA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dyson-omni-glide---vacuum-41c2c92bbf3c47bc890c3f533f2cf606.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dyson</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>Ultra-lightweight at only 2.5 pounds</p></li><li readability=0><p>Of all the vacuums we tested, this is the easiest one to maneuver</p></li><li><p>Great for small messes</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>One of the most expensive vacuums on our list, but also one of the best</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Small dust bin needs emptying often</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dyson vacuum cleaners</a> are known to be some of the best in the industry. If you have hard floors at home, like tile or wood flooring, the Dyson Omni-Glide+ is your best bet. This hardwood floor vacuum was relatively easy to set up, though it doesn't have any worded instructions, only pictures. It sucked up most of the debris during our tests, including coffee grounds, Cheerios, and even cotton balls, but it struggled a bit on the popcorn kernels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Omni-Glide runs for 21 minutes on regular suction power and eight minutes on high, and it's not too loud on either setting. It transitioned smoothly from hardwood to stairs to tile, and at just 2 and a half pounds, it's super lightweight and easy to maneuver. The biggest downside of this stick vacuum is the size of the dust bin. It's only 0.2 liters, so you'll have to empty it every time between uses — potentially multiple times, depending on how long you use it. Still, it's an excellent option for quick clean-ups and small messes. If you're looking for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hardwood floor vacuum</a> and can swing the price, we say go for it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After using this at home for three months, we love it even more.

This high-end German vacuum cleared virtually all of the debris during our tests, including heavier pieces like popcorn kernels and Cheerios. It runs for about 33 minutes on the medium setting and 12 minutes on high. And the light on the head makes it easy to see what you're doing when vacuuming under ledges and dark corners. This stick vacuum is pretty loud on the high setting but not too bad on the regular suction mode.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, the canister is on the smaller side. We had to empty it twice during our tests, which wasn't very convenient. Also, hair got caught within the brush roll, and we had to cut it out with scissors. Still, the Triflex HX2 maneuvers pretty effortlessly and transitions well between different flooring surfaces. It also has a HEPA filter that helps remove allergens from your air. This is one of the most expensive vacuums we tried. Although it might not be worth buying full-price, it's a stellar choice if you can find it on sale.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>51 x 10 x 8 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>5.8 pounds | <strong>Canister Size:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Battery Life:</strong> 33 minutes | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Crevice nozzle, dust brush, upholstery tool, compact brush head</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-cordless-stick-vacuum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Cordless Stick Vacuum</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Floor Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing to consider when buying a cordless stick vacuum is the type of floors you have at home.

Our top pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Eufy by HomeVac 30</a>, weighs less than two pounds, so you can clean your entire home without having to place a heating pad on your back when you're finished.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>HEPA Filter</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, Becnel recommends getting a cordless stick vacuum with a HEPA filter, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Miele Triflex HX2</a>.

After weighing the assembled vacuums, we used a stopwatch to see how long the batteries lasted on low and high power while continuously moving them back and forth. Next, we used a decibel reader to check how noisy they were.
