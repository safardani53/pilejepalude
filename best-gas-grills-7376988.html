To help narrow down your options, we tested 13 of today’s best large gas grills, evaluating their ease of use and cooking abilities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the best large gas grills that PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-monument-grills-stainless-4-burner-propane-gas-grill></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Monument Grills 4-Burner Propane Gas Grill</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Monument Grills Stainless 4-Burner Propane Gas Grill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Nw8PK8r-z5gCv3kMxFwRePA6-g4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/monument-grills-4-burner-propane-gas-grill-a6c129eec1084ba8a92438f67e945502.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Great value for its feature set (hundreds less than others on the list)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>High-quality stainless steel construction</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Responsive to heat adjustments</p></li><li readability=0><p>Intuitive to use, even for beginners</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of size, performance, and value, it’s hard to beat the Monument Grills 4-Burner Propane Gas Grill. This attractive grill has a sleek stainless steel exterior, and it features four burners across its 513-square-inch main cooking area. It has porcelain-coated cast iron grates, and it even includes a 12,000-BTU side burner and a rotisserie kit. Despite all these features, it’s still extremely reasonably priced, costing hundreds less than many other models we tested.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While its spec sheet is nothing to scoff at, we were equally impressed with the performance of this grill. It started up easily thanks to its electronic ignition system, and the heat was easy to adjust using the four knobs on the front of the unit. During testing, we found that the flame was very responsive to the dials from high all the way down to low. The intuitive nature of the heat and use of the burners leaves this grill more consistent in temperature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We cooked hamburgers, steak, and fish during testing, and all the dishes were evenly cooked with nice char marks. The front of the grill does seem to be a bit cooler than the middle and back, but overall, the unit performed reliably. Its size makes it perfect for a large family or frequent host, and its high-quality construction will stand up to years of use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester was a brand new grill user, and they loved the ease of setup and temperature controls on this grill. The performance was effective and consistent, with the grill heating up quickly, retaining the heat, and cooking the food evenly. We do wish there was something to catch stray grease drops, but that's not a dealbreaker. Our tester also noted the side burner can be used as extra counter space when you close the lid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 19 x 54 x 46 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 118 pounds | <strong>Cooking Area:</strong> 723 square inches | <strong>Burners:</strong> 4, plus a side burner | <strong>Maximum BTU:</strong> 60,000 | <strong>Fuel:</strong> Propane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-runner-up-best-overall-weber-spirit-ii-e-310-3-burner-gas-grill></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Runner Up, Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Weber 3-Burner Gas Grill</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Weber Spirit II E-310 3-Burner Gas Grill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/UiRHBUcqfDBC2IRdrJT3HXdhkhU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/weber-spirit-ii-e-310-3-burner-propane-gas-grill-87b18bf3ad094512aeeb1084196ef540.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Responsive to temperature changes</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Sturdy open-cart style construction</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Comes in both propane and natural gas models</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can’t go wrong with Weber gas grills, which are known for easy use and reliability, and after testing several different models, the Spirit II E-310 was our favorite. This popular gas grill is available in both propane and natural gas models, and it features 529 square inches of cooking space over three burners. Its racks are made from porcelain-coated cast iron, and it has an open-cart design with two wheels for easy portability.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, we found the grill was intuitive to operate, even for beginners: The temperature was easy to regulate and responsive, and the internal grill temperature adjusts quickly when knobs are altered. The grill left nice char marks on all the different types of food, and while the grill is slightly hotter in the middle of the grate, its temperature was consistent overall. Plus, we loved that the grill's interior is spacious enough to make cleaning quick and easy. It's the type of grill that'll have you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>grilling foods you didn't know you could</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our one complaint about the Spirit II E-310 is that its built-in lid thermometer is fairly inaccurate. During testing, it was often 50-100 degrees off from our control thermometer, and as such, we didn’t feel confident relying on it to gauge the inner temperature of the grill.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we appreciated how this grill facilitated entertaining for large groups. It's well-built, heats up quickly, and cooks food evenly. We did notice the propane tank has to be opened for a few moments to build pressure so the burners work correctly. We also appreciate the hooks on this grill that allow you to hang some of your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>grilling accessories</a>, and how the grill can be partially disassembled for easy transport.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 52 x 27 x 44.5 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 114 pounds | <strong>Cooking Area:</strong> 529 square inches | <strong>Burners:</strong> 3 | <strong>Maximum BTU: </strong>30,000 |<strong> Fuel:</strong> Propane or Natural Gas</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nexgrill-4-burner-propane-gas-grill></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nexgrill 4-Burner Propane Gas Grill</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nexgrill 4-Burner Propane Gas Grill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/HBB8o0TH02WEcJPoQhqwMiNZpOs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nexgrill-4-Burner-Gas-Grill-with-Side-Burner-374c9531c450457fbf2578e80e042683.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Home Depot</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Low price for a fairly large grill</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Lightweight and easy to move</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Temperature responds quickly to adjustments</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a big grill without a big price tag, the Nexgrill 4-Burner Gas Grill is worth considering. It has a fairly basic, no-frills design, but it has a 417-square-inch main cooking grate with four burners, giving you plenty of space to grill for a crowd. It also features a handy side burner and an electronic ignition, and it weighs significantly less than other grills, making it easy to move around as needed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Nexgrill was fairly average in terms of its performance — it didn’t get quite as hot as some of the more expensive grills and had a few hot spots, but it still got the job done. It performs best on basics like hamburgers and hot dogs, and the grill responded quickly to any temperature changes during testing, making it easy to control. However, if you do opt for this budget-friendly grill, be warned that assembly is time-consuming and a bit complicated — of all the grills we tested, it took us the longest to put together due to its unclear instructions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After one month of usage, we can say the grill has a reliable quick-start ignition, good temperature control, and effective performance. So far, everything is working as it should, and our tester was happy that food hasn't stuck to the grates once. The top rack works well to keep some foods warm while others continue grilling so our tester was able to fit two fajita pans on the main grates while corn cooked on the top rack. One concern is that moisture gets into the thermometer, which could affect the gauge's performance over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 49.5 x 24.2 x 46.5 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 72.8 pounds | <strong>Cooking Area:</strong> 562 square inches | <strong>Burners:</strong> 4, plus side burner | <strong>Maximum BTU: </strong>40,000 | <strong>Fuel:</strong> Propane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-weber-genesis-e-325s-3-burner-gas-grill></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Weber Genesis E-325s 3-Burner Gas Grill</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Weber Genesis E-325s 3-Burner Gas Grill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/G7fyddf_Uu0grGZ7W2phYmj16n4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/weber-genesis-e-325s-3-burner-gas-grill-f07539057c9b40b0aa466dfa99c5b877.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Sear zone delivers a perfectly crispy texture on meat</p></li><li readability=-1><p>High-quality construction will last for years</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Comes in both propane and natural gas models</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Weber Genesis E-325S is a worthwhile investment for frequent grillers, as it’s simply a joy to use. It comes in both propane and natural gas models, and there are even three different finishes to choose from. The grill has three burners, as well as a special high-heat searing zone, and its primary cooking grate is 513 square inches, providing plenty of space for your food.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it came to testing, the Genesis E-325S proved that it’s worth its high price tag. This grill could cook anything, and it has a large capacity, so cooking multiple things that need different attention is a huge draw. There weren’t any noticeable hot spots across the cooking grates, and we found the “sear zone” delivered a crispy outer texture on meat. We were also impressed with the overall construction of the grill, noting that it could easily last for 10 years if taken care of properly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A rockstar for beginners, this grill is easy to set up, use, and clean, and the large internal capacity creates space for effective cooking. The propane tank also has a meter to track when you need more, which is super helpful.

This two-burner grill is smaller than many others we tested, with just 325 square inches of cooking space on its main surface, but it’s reasonably priced to match and has several unique features that make it exceptionally easy to operate.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In testing, we found that the grill’s “TRU-Infrared plates” — basically perforated stainless steel plates underneath the cooking grates — provide impressive heat distribution, preventing any hot spots and allowing all our food to cook evenly. It also effectively prevented any flare-ups, making it a good choice for new grillers. However, the downside of the plates is any grease that drips onto them ends up smoking, which may affect the flavor of your food. Overall, we think this grill is a great value, especially for beginners or those who don’t necessarily need an extra-large cooking area.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During one month of testing, our team loved using this grill. The temperature controls are intuitive, and the infrared capabilities of the grates and burners are top-notch. It actually exceeded our griller's expectations in terms of heat retention, the overall searing capabilities, and the efficacy of the burner zones — which provided more than enough space for direct and indirect cooking. Our tester tried a variety of cooking methods, and this grill aced them all, plus, it's incredibly simple to clean once you're finished grilling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 22.5 x 46.8 x 47.2 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 99 pounds | <strong>Cooking Area:</strong> 445 square inches | <strong>Burners:</strong> 2 | <strong>Maximum BTU: </strong>20,000 | <strong>Fuel:</strong> Propane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-2-burner-weber-spirit-ii-e-210-2-burner-liquid-propane-grill></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best 2-Burner</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Weber Spirit II E-210 Grill</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Weber Spirit II E-210 2-Burner Liquid Propane Grill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0MFIC6Wrt9aJrR9oGKSaY4rFlTc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/weber-spirit-ii-e-210-2-burner-liquid-propane-grill-161caf3184214034b2aa16cd152c3eb2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Spacious cooking area for a two-burner grill</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Built-in fuel gauge shows how much propane is left</p></li><li readability=0><p>Very similar to our Best Overall, Runner Up option — minus one burner</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you usually only cook for a few people at a time, the Weber Spirit II E-210 is a more compact (and affordable) option for your patio.

Despite its smaller size, the E-210 has a primary cooking area of 360 square inches, and it has most of the same features as the more expensive model, including enamel-coated cast iron grates, an open cart design, and integrated tool hooks.

The spacious interior was easy to clean and provided a good surface area for cooking quite a few foods at once. It evenly sears food, and the small size makes it great for all grillers, but especially easy to use and store for beginners. We do wish both sides of the shelf folded down and that there were four wheels to roll it around rather than two, but overall it's a great grill.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 44.5 x 48 x 27 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 103 pounds | <strong>Cooking Area:</strong> 450 square inches | <strong>Burners:</strong> 2 | <strong>Maximum BTU: </strong>26,500 | <strong>Fuel:</strong> Propane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smart-weber-genesis-ex-325s-propane-gas-smart-grill></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Smart</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Weber Genesis EX-325S Smart Gas Grill</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Weber Genesis EX-325S Propane Gas Smart Grill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SJNPWjCin2O4e3_kbdzrTUBfkoM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/weber-genesis-smart-ex-325s-3-burner-gas-grill-0ee5f84a1fc941af99a2143ffddc06bc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Home Depot</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Temperature probes monitor food doneness</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Connects to smartphone via Bluetooth and sends you real-time temp alerts and reminders</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Comes in both propane and natural gas models</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Weber Genesis EX-325S is essentially the same grill as our pick for best investment, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Weber Genesis E-325S</a>, but it has added smart features that are sure to please any tech-savvy grillers.

The grill performed so well that the app was almost unnecessary (though convenient when you step away while cooking). Just keep in mind that this grill’s high price is largely due to its smart features, so if you don’t think you’ll use them, save yourself a few bucks and stick with the Genesis E-325S.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester used the grill at least three times a week over one month and loved the simple app setup, ease of use, and high-quality performance. Cooking is a breeze thanks to smart technology that helps avoid undercooked food and enables you to achieve the perfect char marks. Our tester grilled vegetables, steak, burgers, chicken, and sausage, and each food cooked perfectly, achieving delicious results.

However, if ease of cleaning isn't your top priority, we think you should consider this grill for your next summer BBQ.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester called the grill "one of the best we have ever owned or tried."

Propane grills are typically more popular, as they’re powered by 20-pound liquid propane tanks, which you can purchase from most home improvement stores. These tanks are convenient to use and can be refilled as needed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you have a natural gas line in your home, there are some gas grills that can use this type of fuel. Some grills come with a conversion kit that lets you change them from propane to natural gas, while other grills are solely designed to use with natural gas. Many Weber grills, including our runner-up for best overall, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Weber Spirit II E-310 3-Burner Gas Grill</a>, can be purchased in both liquid propane or natural gas models.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Capacity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When comparing different grills, one of the key factors to consider is its capacity, which is measured in square inches.

This is where you’ll place meat and other food that needs high heat to be cooked, so you’ll want to select a grill that’s spacious enough for your needs. If you have a smaller family, a grill with a 200-300 square inch primary cooking surface will likely be plenty, but if you regularly host parties, you may want a grill with 500+ square inches of cooking space so you can cook more food at a time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Secondary cooking space, on the other hand, includes any additional racks within the grill, which are often used for cooking with indirect heat or warming up items like burger buns.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Burners</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Large gas grills can have anywhere from two to six burners, but most people find that three or four burners is the sweet spot when cooking for multiple people. When your grill has multiple burners, you’re able to create different cooking zones across its grates.
