They’re the most nourishing thing you can use for your hair because they can actually penetrate into the hair, providing nourishment, adding shine, and offering long-lasting smoothing benefits,” explains celebrity hairstylist Mara Rozak, who’s worked with clients like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emma Stone</a>. If you’re thinking to yourself that this sounds a lot like what you could get from a standard bottle of conditioner, you’re not entirely wrong; however, while conditioners mostly just sit on top of the hair, oils can penetrate on a deeper level for even greater benefits, Rozak explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s currently no shortage of hair oil options out there, so to figure out which ones are the best of the best, we put 29 hair oils through the ringer. While there are a few different ways you can use a hair oil (more on that point in a moment), we applied them on damp hair before blow-drying and styling. Each product was evaluated for feel and absorption, and, of course, for how it left strands looking and feeling.&nbsp;After using our top picks at home for six months, we updated our insights below.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the best hair oils that PEOPLE tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-olaplex-no7-bonding-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olaplex Bonding Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/k7B17uUgjEsmQ-l9FDOO_wNRcQg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/olaplez-33d9a6bdc6e84141913f43da88d75f70.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Shine/Sheen</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Acts as both a reparative treatment oil and styling oil</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Effective for all hair types and textures</p></li><li readability=2><p>Earned perfect scores in our tests due to quick absorption, lightweight feel, and soft and shiny results</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This brand started the trend when it comes to haircare products that help to combat damage by repairing the disulfide bonds in the hair that are broken when we do everything from comb to color our strands — and this oil does exactly that. To that point, it’s a super effective treatment oil, but also has plenty of styling benefits, namely combating frizz, keeping color vibrant, and offering both heat and UV protection.&nbsp;(While it’s meant to be used on damp or dry hair pre-styling, celebrity hairstylist Anthony Cristiano — who’s worked with A-listers such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Demi Moore</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Mariah Carey</a> — says it can also be used as a pre-shampoo treatment.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It was a runaway hit during our tests and earned a perfect score in every category, due to the lightweight and non-sticky feel, how quickly it absorbed, and how it left our hair feeling so soft and shiny, as if we just left the salon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of our team members has been using this Olaplex hair oil every day for six months, and she is completely floored by the difference it has made in her hair. It does such a fantastic job at really calming down frizz and dry ends without making them greasy. It even worked as a heat protectant for her hair extensions that were on their last leg. We've already recommended this hair oil to friends, and we still stand behind it as our top pick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate, grapeseed oil, fermented green tea oil | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Repairs broken bonds, offers heat and UV protection, fights frizz, help maintain color<strong> </strong>vibrancy | <strong>Size:</strong> 1 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loral-paris-elvive-extraordinary-oil-deep-nourishing-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oréal Paris Deep Nourishing Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Or&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;al Paris Elvive Extraordinary Oil Deep Nourishing Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6SdzVuWosUCz_RH1LPI0tjG56vo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loral-paris-elvive-extraordinary-oil-deep-nourishing-treatment-7d364ff41bd24786b5144b14678d5e74.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Shine/Sheen</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>Can be used as a pre-shampoo treatment, before styling, or finishing product</p></li><li><p>A little goes a long way</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Lightweight feel and scent</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Great for dry hair or those struggling with dead ends</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s proof positive that you don’t need to shell out the big bucks for a great hair oil. In fact, we were impressed with this bargain pick, loving the nice scent, very lightweight feel, and non-stickiness, which is surprising since you can buy it at the drugstore. Even just three drops of it made our hair very hydrated and soft. It scored perfect marks in every category — except for overall look where it earned a 4 out of 5. While it did leave our hair much more sleek, it didn’t particularly look shinier than normal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This affordable hair oil "gives life back" to our tester's long, brown locks daily. She admittedly has dead ends, heat damage, and dull and dry hair. But when she uses this hair oil before blow drying, her hair comes out silky smooth, and it's also effective post-styling. "When I apply the oil to my ends on dry, styled hair (normally curled or waved), my once dead and dry ends look newly nourished and frizz free," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, soybean oil | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Hydrates, combats frizz | <strong>Size:</strong> 3.4 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-non-greasy-living-proof-no-frizz-vanishing-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Non-Greasy</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Living Proof Hair Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Living Proof No-Frizz Vanishing Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/NMsJigTwLorC0D-tWjDBtv_l6PQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/living-proof-no-frizz-vanishing-oil-0cf1544b0c69445cb27255fe1c26af68.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Shine/Sheen</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Works well for fine to very thick or coarse hair</p></li><li><p>Pleasant rose scent</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Absorbs beautifully into the hair</p></li><li readability=2><p>After six months of use, we noticed a drastic improvement in hair softness, frizziness, and shine</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This winner is a great example of the fact that “oil” isn’t always synonymous with “greasy.” The formula relies on a blend of five different oils (including jojoba and moringa seed) that work to mimic the natural oils of the hair. Couple that with the fact that the other emollient ingredients in the formula are quick-drying and you get a product that absorbs thoroughly and quickly into the hair so it won't feel greasy. In fact, we noted that it completely soaked into our strands in under 15 seconds. We also found it left hair with a beautiful sheen and effectively controlled frizz, even on a humid, summer day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After six months, we're even more in love with the Living Proof hair oil. Our tester said this hair oil has improved the overall look of her hair drastically, and it continues to keep it feeling soft, less frizzy, and much more healthy looking, with a nice bouncy shine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Five-oil blend including jojoba oil and moringa seed oil | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Hydrates and smoothes hair, reduces frizz, enhances shine | <strong>Size:</strong> 1.7 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-verb-ghost-weightless-hair-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Fine Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Verb Ghost Weightless Hair Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Verb Ghost Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/NcjfXAhQA4_Trg_KP875nwhng9k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/verb-ghost-oil--vegan-weightless-hair-oil--lightweight-hair-oil--revitalizing-hair-treatment-oil-nourishes-and-promotes-shine--paraben-free-sulfate-free-smoothing-oil-4688efd01ee14ab7aa1a17c05fa7f3ce.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Shine/Sheen</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>Extremely light and weightless</p></li><li readability=0><p>Includes soy protein, which helps strengthen hair</p></li><li readability=0><p>Absorbs quickly and beautifully, despite its thickness</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Doesn't make blonde hair brassy because it's a clear oil</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who have fine hair, the idea of using a hair oil can admittedly sound like a recipe for ending up with a limp, greasy mess. But that’s certainly not the case with this extremely featherweight winner. During tests, we thought this product would be very heavy since it was very thick, but the oil absorbed beautifully into thin hair. We wouldn’t even be scared to use this at the roots because of how well it absorbs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to the brand, the moringa-oil-based formula showed to increase shine by 75 percent in their own testing; but our tester felt that number might be a little optimistic. We appreciate that it doesn't make blonde hair brassy (because it's clear) and that it's so lightweight, but it's worth noting that it didn’t wholly tame all of our frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After six months, we still love that this oil is so lightweight, and the pump bottle makes it super easy to apply. While our tester appreciated that it still doesn't make her blonde hair brassy or heavy, she was disappointed it didn't help prevent split ends. It's still a great rec for those with fine or light-colored hair, but if you've got dry or damaged hair, it might be worth opting for a more heavy-duty hair oil, like our pick below.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Moringa oil, bamboo extract, hydrolyzed soy protein | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Softens, adds shine and moisture | <strong>Size:</strong> 2 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-hair-ogx-renewing--argan-oil-of-morocco-penetrating-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Damaged Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OGX Extra Penetrating Argan Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="OGX Extra Strength Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XSHLCpRQtBdD6oaYg9NUDG8Z-8I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ogx-extra-strength-renewing---argan-oil-of-morocco-7bf84e09f9a04ea7b1e1fc568236d7ec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Effective hair oil that’s an excellent value (only $8!)</p></li><li readability=0><p>Relies on argan oil, which is rich in protective antioxidants</p></li><li readability=0><p>Heavy and thick, so it's super nourishing for very damaged hair</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Bottle doesn’t come with a dropper, which makes application a bit more challenging</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Not a great pick for fine hair</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A hair oil is a great option for anyone with stressed tresses, and this one in particular is a good pick. The namesake oil is loaded with moisturizing, vitamin E, and protective antioxidants, leaving hair smooth, silky, and shiny. It is a bit on the richer side. We tested this on thick, dry hair and loved how well it moisturized strands, but it may be a bit too much for finer hair.

(It has to do with the fact that it’s harder for the scalp’s natural oils to travel all the way down a curly hair shaft.) That’s why a deeply moisturizing hair oil, such as this one, can be so invaluable. It’s chock-full of a laundry list of different oils for an end result that we found left hair well and evenly-moisturized. Just keep in mind that this is a bit of a thicker product and a little goes a long way; it scored only a 3 out of 5 when it came to absorption. For $22, though, it's a great value, especially because it comes in a large 8-oz. bottle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After using this product for six months, our hair is healthier, and we've figured out the perfect way to use this oil. Our tester found that applying a little bit every day to her dry ends helped her achieve her ideal look, and she also uses it as a heat protectant and hair mask every once in a while. If you have thick, curly, natural hair, then this oil can weigh your hair down if you use too much. A little really does go a long way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Sweet almond oil, avocado oil, jojoba seed oil | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Softens the hair and locks in moisture | <strong>Size:</strong> 8 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-scalp-ceremonia-aceite-de-moska-scalp-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Scalp</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ceremonia Aceite de Moska Scalp Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ceremnoia Aceite de Moska" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/83zRw8n9cZjQEHvyXm8jh-TGpP8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ceremnoia-aceite-de-moska-644295dec135404faed0b53a5a532580.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ceremonia</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Made with eight different oils</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Improves the look and feel of hair as well as the scalp</p></li><li><p>Softens wiry grays</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Saw hair growth after a few months of using</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In case you missed the memo, you can’t have healthy hair without a healthy scalp, hence why a scalp oil made its way on this list. And even though it’s called a scalp oil and is meant to work more on the skin than the hair, it still delivers some hair benefits. For example, we found that it absorbed nicely, softened wiry grays, and smoothed hair out as well. Still, for the best results, you’ll want to work this more onto your scalp than your hair, letting the combination of eight different oils do their thing to nourish and balance the skin — a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalp massager</a> would be great for this. The formula also helps break down any build-up on the scalp, too. It's good to let it sit a little while before showering, which might be a con for you if you don't like waiting around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there weren't immediate results for us during home testing, we did notice hair growth after consistently using the product. It's a pre-shower oil, and we love that you don't have to be super careful about the amount used. It's fairly lightweight, so you can really work it into your scalp before showing. We also didn't find the 10 to 15-minute waiting period inconvenient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Meadowfoam seed oil, chia seed oil, babassu seed oil | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Nourishes scalp, reduces frizz, strengthens hair | <strong>Size:</strong> 2 fl. oz.</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-22 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottle of Ceremnoia Aceite de Moska in a try next to hair ties and a brush" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/n1-PcGqtv6PathL5YrVwuTwJz5g=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_Ceremonia_AceitedeMoska_tstaples_406-2442ea4a996a4a3fb60b01c6b2dbadf7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4342 data-sizes=750px alt="Person drying their hair while testing Ceremnoia Aceite de Moska" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/NE7NtUTi8XE7lXUuOKdtxN1LAss=/fit-in/1500x4342/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hair-oil-test-ceremonia-aceitede-moska-tstaples-709-ab77c591c1d44b13b527a4ee50e3df72.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smoothing-playa-ritual-hair-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Smoothing</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Playa Ritual Hair Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Playa Ritual Hair Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/K7UWgcjpIBWbjeuPO5gkn34lIr4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/playa-2e2b3b4cc34342538a415ffc1091cb77.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Morphe</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Shine/Sheen</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Cap has a built-in pump dispenser that dispenses the perfect amount of product every time</p></li><li><p>Silicone-free formula</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Works on both damp and dry hair</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Protects against UV damage</p></li><li readability=0><p>After six months of use, there is obvious improvement in shine and frizziness</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s really nothing this hair oil can’t do.

Ends got even softer as time went on, and while we didn’t notice too much shine at first, the difference was significant as the hair dried and sat for longer.

Some of the best ones to look for? “Jojoba, coconut, sesame seed, and sunflower oil are all excellent for restoring moisture to the hair, as well as protecting against sun damage,” says Cristiano. Rozak agrees with all of the above and adds argan oil to the list (which can be found in picks like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">OGX Extra Penetrating Moroccan Argan Oil</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kérastase Elixir Ultime Hydrating Hair Oil Serum</a>), noting that it contains powerful antioxidants that protect against heat damage.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Purpose</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like with other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair products</a>, not all hair oils are exactly the same. Some are meant to be used more as styling products (such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair detanglers</a>), enhancing shine and fighting frizz, whereas others act as treatment products, offering a heavy dose of moisture and helping to repair damage. (That being said, many of the ones on the market, and many of the winners on this list, can be used both ways.) “When looking for a styling oil, the formula should feel lightweight” says Rozak. "Ideally, you should test it on the palms of your hands and make sure it’s not leaving behind a sticky residue. When looking for a treatment oil, look for products that say they’re reparative or call out that they’re a treatment." So, if you're using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>shampoo for thinning hair</a> seek out hair oils that promote hair growth.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Silicone-Free</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many hair oils do also contain silicones, ingredients that make the hair feel and look smooth, but sit on top of the strands. Some of the ones that aren’t water-soluble can build up on hair — that's when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shampoos for oily hair</a> can help mitigate the effects of excess oil and product buildup. They’re not necessarily ingredients you need to avoid, but if you are looking to reap the benefits of the oils and the oils alone, stick with silicone-free hair oils. Many on this list are silicone-free formulas, including <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">JVN Complete Nourishing Shine Drops</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Melanin Multi-Use Pure Oil Blend</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-hair-oils></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Hair Oils</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our PEOPLE Tested team spent a day trying out 29 different hair oils in our testing lab. To start, we first dampened clean hair, then sectioned it into two parts so that we could test two oils at once (which was helpful for directly comparing oils against each other). Using provided guidelines for how much oil to apply based on hair-length (two to three drops for short, three to five for shoulder-length, five to eight for chest-length, and eight to ten for waist-length), we worked the product in from the ends to the roots. After letting it soak in for 30 seconds (unless otherwise noted on the product label), we took note of how the hair looked and felt, as well as how well the oil absorbed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, we blow-dried each section, and then once again reassessed, paying particular attention to how shiny it was. Ultimately, each product was ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 in the following categories: application, absorption, feel, and overall look. The products with the highest average ratings made this PEOPLE Tested list of best hair oils.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We continued to use our favorite hair oils for six months and noted any changes after one month, three months, and six months.

They’re also great styling products, helping to smooth the hair, tame frizz, and add plenty of shine — not to mention offer heat protection from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair dryers</a> and other heat tools.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What’s the best way to use a hair oil?</span></p><p>This depends on exactly what you want it to do for you. If you’re using it as more of a styling product, apply it right out of the shower on damp, towel-dried hair, before blow-drying or air-drying suggests Rozak. However, if you want it to be more of a treatment, you’ll want to use it on dry hair: “Our hair is the most porous when it’s dry, so the oil will be able to penetrate the most deeply,” Rozak explains. Leave it on for as long as possible before shampooing; she says doing so overnight is ideal.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.95951417004049><p><span class=accordion__title>Which oil makes hair grow faster?</span></p><p>In order for healthy hair growth, the scalp needs to be healthy — and for a healthy scalp, essential oils are your best bet, says Cristiano. They're often key players in many top <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair growth products</a>. More specifically, “Sage, rosemary, lemon, and cyprus essential oils soothe the scalp and can help rebalance moisture levels if you’re experiencing dryness or excess sebum,” he explains. “They help to create a healthy environment for hair growth.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Melanie Rud</a> is a freelance beauty writer and editor living in Chicago.
