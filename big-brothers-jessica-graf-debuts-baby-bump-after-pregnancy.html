  By popular demand! My first bump photo 💕 I’ve had a lot of people ask me to post photos of my bump, and honestly, I’ve chosen not to because people online can be TROLLS! I’m very confident, and rude comments don’t bother me anymore. I’ve developed tough skin for it and I’ve also developed one hell of a “Blocked” list so I dont see most of it."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

My first bump photo 💕 I’ve had a lot of people ask me to post photos of my bump, and honestly, I’ve chosen not to because people online can be TROLLS! I’m very confident, and rude comments don’t bother me anymore. I’ve developed tough skin for it and I’ve also developed one hell of a “Blocked” list so I dont see most of it. The few rude comments I do see, Cody and I enjoy laughing at because the effort put in to hurt someone you have never mets feelings, it’s pretty pathetic! So I’ve avoided putting my bump photos online to avoid opening the door for body shaming. If you’re sitting there thinking, “Who would body shame someone who’s pregnant?” Congratulations. You’re a human who has common sense and A SOUL! Unfortunately, not everyone does and there will still be hate somewhere on this post! What made me change my mind and encouraged me to post my bump update was an individual I just started following, @sazan. She recently posted a very vulnerable photo of her 3 weeks postpartum. Seeing your body go through such drastic changes is hard and can sometimes take a hit to your confidence level! But I would rather be a woman like @sazan who inspires confidence than to avoid the issue all together! So to all my Mommas out there, you’re BEAUTIFUL and the haters can SUCK IT!</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>JESSICA NICKSON</a> (@thejessicagraf) on Dec 6, 2018 at 12:27pm PST</p><p>Bumpin’ and proud. <a href=#>Big Brother</a> star <strong>Jessica Graf</strong> showed off her very first baby bump photo after initially keeping it under wraps due to online trolls.</p><p>“By popular demand! My first bump photo,” the reality star captioned a <a href=#>shot of herself</a> standing in front of a fireplace with a stocking bearing her husband and former costar <strong>Cody Nickson</strong>’s name.</p><p>The mama-to-be, 27, who is wearing a black turtleneck and a bodyskin gray midi skirt in the shot, also revealed how far along she is, holding up a sign that reads, “I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling 22.”</p><p>Graf, who <a href=#>announced her pregnancy</a> in September, explained why she’s waited so long to post a bump picture in the accompanying caption. “I’ve had a lot of people ask me to post photos of my bump, and honestly, I’ve chosen not to because people online can be TROLLS!” she wrote. “I’m very confident, and rude comments don’t bother me anymore. I’ve developed thick skin for it and I’ve also developed one hell of a “Blocked” list so I don’t see most of it. The few rude comments I do see, Cody and I enjoy laughing at because the effort put in to hurt someone you have never mets feelings, it’s pretty pathetic!”</p><p>She continued: “So I’ve avoided putting my bump photos online to avoid opening the door for body shaming. If you’re sitting there thinking, “Who would body shame someone who’s pregnant?” Congratulations. You’re a human who has common sense and A SOUL! Unfortunately, not everyone does and there will still be hate somewhere on this post!”</p><p>Ultimately, the <a href=#>Amazing Race</a> season 30 winner said she decided to post her pics regardless, after seeing another woman, <a href=#>@sazan</a>, share a picture of herself at 3 weeks postpartum. “Seeing your body go through such drastic changes is hard and can sometimes take a hit to your confidence,”&nbsp;Graf wrote. “But I would rather be a woman like <a href=#>@sazan</a> who inspires confidence than to avoid the issue altogether!”</p><p>Her changing body certainly hasn’t changed Nickson’s view of his wife: On Tuesday, December 4, the former marine, 33, <a href=#>posted a photo</a> of the two at an event on Instagram, writing, “She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.”</p><p>“You’re such a smart man,” Graf jokingly replied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jessica-Graf-Debuts-Baby-Bump.jpg><p>Graf also had the support of “Auntie V,” a.k.a. <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> alum <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Grimaldi</strong></a>, who commented on her post on Thursday, writing, “Woah woah woah — it’s one thing to be a troll, but it’s another to BODY shame a woman, especially a pregnant one. Always amazes me when someone can think of a negative or hurtful thought, let that thought get to their fingertips, act it out by typing it and actually press ‘post’ for the whole world to see. Mama, you are a strong and beautiful soul and the people that do know and love you, will never judge you for anything. Enjoy every second of pregnancy and I can’t wait to tell the little one how brave of a momma she has!”</p><p>The expectant mommy revealed that she was with child when she shared an ultrasound pic on Instagram on September 24. “WE’RE PREGNANT! And I’m over the moon!” she wrote at the time. “I’m so excited to bring our first child into this life we have created together!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The loving pair met on season 19 of Big Brother.
