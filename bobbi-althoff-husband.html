According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JustJared</a>, Bobbi and Cory jumped the broom sometime after getting engaged in October 2019.</p><p>However, Bobbi shared in an August 2023 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a> feature that she prefers to keep her relationship private.</p><p>As for Cory, he seems to also be partial to privacy as his Instagram page is currently private. That said, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn page</a> gives us a bit to work with.</p><p>Cory currently works as the senior vice president of Software Development Programs at CompTIA. He first joined the company in April 2022 as the senior vice president of Coding Programs and received two promotions that include senior vice president of Faculty Academy in July 2022 and his current position in February 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In his bio, he describes his position as an outlet to “help people learn the skills they need to have successful careers in tech.” Additionally, Cory’s bio shares that he is a “programmer, speaker, and author whose work includes The Self-Taught Programmer and The Self-Taught Computer Scientist.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The bio also highlights that Cory “taught himself to program and eventually became a software engineer at eBay” after graduating from Clemson University as a political science major.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bobbi and Cory are parents of two daughters.</h2><p>The happy couple are parents to two daughters.

Since it’s clear that Cory prefers to focus on his family and work in the tech field, it doesn’t come as a surprise that details about his family life are unknown.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Truth be told, Cory may simply believe that just because Bobbi is growing her brand doesn’t mean that he has to give up his appreciation for privacy. And judging by how Bobbi is intentional with keeping her family life and work life separate, that’s likely the case. In other words, that’s what makes her and Cory a great match.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7yjrshmmKWsmKSzp3nHrqqbmZ6Z</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyson-fury-shows-off-belts-to-boxing-officials-as-they-decide-future-of-his-career.html><span>←</span><span>Tyson Fury shows off belts to boxing officials as they decide future of his career</span></a>
