I have three brothers and three sisters; [we’re] all lifelong Chicago Cubs fans.</p><p>4. I’ve had dogs by the names of PT109, Whiskey, Happy, Buddy, Lacey and Charlie.</p><p>5. I volunteer as an advocate for newly diagnosed cancer patients.</p><p>6. I improvised the line “We’re walking, we’re walking, and we’re stopping” as the tour guide in the [1993] movie Dave.</p><p>7. I cowrote, costarred in and directed MGM’s romantic comedy Return to Me [from 2000].</p><p>8. I’m allergic to the chemicals in perfume and colognes.</p><p>9. My most frequent brag is pointing out the plaque dedicated [to me] at the Casa Colina hospital that reads: “BONNIE HUNT – Movie Star, Director, Producer, Writer, Entrepreneur and Media Innovator … but always a Nurse.”</p><p>10. When I was a teen, my mom saved every dime to buy tickets for my siblings and me to see Elvis live!</p><p>11. I wake each day to a playlist of my favorite music. I believe music is healing.</p><p>12. I’m a huge <strong>Bruno Mars</strong> fan. I’ve been to see him live a few times.</p><p>13. <strong>Brad Paisley</strong> taught me how to fly fish.</p><p>14.

I’ve been working with my dear friend Kathy Giusti, the founder of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, for almost two decades.</p><p>17. My all-time favorite TV shows as a child included The Rockford Files and Columbo.</p><p>18. I was featured in the neighborhood newspaper as a teen for breaking the record for most hours volunteered as a candy striper.</p><p>19. My most frequent vacation spot is Italy.</p><p>20. I designed furniture in my home.</p><p>21. I would love to have a second career as an interior designer.</p><p>22. I take a daily walk on the beach and collect heart-shaped rocks.</p><p>23. [When] I worked in a nursing home, I would cover the soles of my shoes with metal thumbtacks so I could tap dance for the patients.</p><p>24. My favorite memory of walking to grade school in the blistering Chicago winter is of my mom preparing hard-boiled eggs for us to carry in our mittens to keep our hands warm, then to eat for breakfast.</p><p>25. The advice “never fear failure” gave me the confidence to become the first woman in television to single-handedly create, write and star in prime-time sitcom The Building.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Escape at Dannemora airs on Showtime, Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmopp6esm601KerZmplYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6pbvNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqWVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angham-19720119-html.html><span>←</span><span>Angham (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
