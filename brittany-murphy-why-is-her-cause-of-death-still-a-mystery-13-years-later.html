And I don’t do drugs. I have a glass of champagne now and then. I’m generally the person dancing at a party who everybody always thinks is the intoxicated one, but I’m really not.”</p><p>In a later interview, Murphy reiterated that she rarely drank alcohol, and denied reports that she was addicted to cocaine:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“No, just for the record I have never tried it in my entire life, I’ve never even seen it, and I don’t leave the house too much, except to go to work,” she told Jane magazine in 2005.</p><p>Speculation about Brittany’s private life increased again in 2007, when she married an unknown British writer and photographer named Simon Monjack.</p><p>“She wanted to marry him and I said, ‘Honey, it’s not been long enough,'” recalls Murphy’s friend and King of the Hill co-star Kathy Najimy.</p><p>“I think Sharon [Brittany’s mother] was for the marriage…We were all scared and freaked out, like, who was this guy and what was happening?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rather creepily, Simon recalled that Brittany was “too young to touch” when he first met her, adding, “To make a long story short, I was very patient.”</p><p>Regarding the rumors about why the pair married so after they started dating (Monjack’s US visa was reportedly on the verge of expiration), Brittany’s husband explained, “We never addressed it [publicly], and I’m not going to now.”</p><p>In one of her final interviews, Murphy was asked about her plans for the upcoming year:</p><p>“As far as having a New Year’s resolution, I’d love to have a child next year,” she shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I’ve been very blessed to have a really great loving husband. I spend more time with my family than anyone else in the world.”</p><p>Just weeks later, Murphy passed away.</p><p>Deepening the mystery is the fact that Monjack died just five months later under similar circumstances.</p><p>His death was also attributed to an unusual combination of health problems, including pneumonia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The timing has led to theories that the ill-fated husband and wife were living in a home that was infested with toxic mold.</p><p>But all these years later, fans still aren’t satisfied by any of the answers to the question of what killed Brittany Murphy.</p><p>And at this point, it seems unlikely that the mystery will ever be solved.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2BcK7RoqutmZ6ueq7B0amfsmWnncZutdJmn56qXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0jKyroqScYq5uudisq56qqWJ%2BdHnYnpirq12hrrWx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a9kso3tvuvksn3hhfjzefutnifmb2war.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Atlanta Season 8 Episode 1: A New Dawn</span></a>
