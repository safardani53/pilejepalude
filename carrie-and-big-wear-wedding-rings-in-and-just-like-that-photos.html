Noth, 66, held Parker‚Äôs face, clearly displaying Big‚Äôs wedding band, while the Carrie actress held onto his waist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Carrie-Big-Reunite-Sex-and-the-City-Sequel-Series-Photos-002.jpg><p>‚ÄúThese 2.

Both wore dark colors and formal attire, but neither had their wedding bands on. Sex and the City fans have seen Carrie and Big have ups and downs, and there is concern among fans that And Just Like That could follow their divorce.</p><p>Fans will have to wait until the series debuts on HBO Max next year to find out.</p><p>Noth needed some convincing to return as Big. After six seasons and two movies, the Law & Order alum was ready to put down the cosmos.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>‚Äú<a href=#>It was a little bit of a sort of creative negotiation</a> because I didn‚Äôt really feel I had anything to offer in that role again,‚Äù the actor told<a href=#> Yahoo Finance Live</a> in June. ‚ÄúIt kind of felt like I had done it, but [executive producer] <strong>Michael Patrick King</strong> is just an incredible writer and has incredible, creative ideas, and once we got together and talked about the potential of what we could do with the character, I was all in.‚Äù</p><p>And Just Like That will feature many new and returning characters, but <a href=#>Samantha Jones will be missing</a>.
