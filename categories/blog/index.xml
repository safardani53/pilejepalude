The amount of body armour you need will depend on the type of mountain biking you’re doing – for example, cross country riding is less risky than downhill or dirt jumps – but a good pair of gloves is generally the bare minimum.</description></item><item><title>Christopher Mitchum Biography</title><link>/christopher-mitchum.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/christopher-mitchum.html</guid><description>Christopher Mitchum is an American actor, screenwriter, and businessman.
