Well just take a look at the likes of <a href=#>Kylie Jenner,</a> <a href=#>Charlotte Crosby</a> and <a href=#>Lauren Goodger</a>.</p><p>Here Fabulous takes a look back at the drastic celeb lip filler transformations - and they're guaranteed to make your jaw drop.</p><h3>Kylie Jenner</h3><p>The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was just 17 years old when she got temporary lip fillers for the first time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000470447485.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000613740299.jpg><p>In 2017, she revealed during her E! solo reality show <a href=#>she was left "insecure" after a crush made a dig at the size of her lips</a>.</p><p>She recalled: "I had really small lips, and it was, like, one of my first kisses, and a guy was like, 'I didn't think you'd be a good kisser because you have such small lips'. I took that really hard."</p><p>After welcoming her daughter Stormi in 2018, <a href=#>Kylie revealed she had her fillers dissolved as she felt she had become "addicted"</a> and said it was becoming "very painful".</p><p>Five months later, Kylie thanked the <a href=#>Beverly-Hills based aesthetician Pawnta</a> on Instagram for her "lip touch up".</p><p>Talking through Kylie's treatment with <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a>, Pawnta said: "We just did a touchup of Juvederm Ultra XC, which is just hyaluronic acid, a derma filler that we use for the lips. She doesn't need much and she’s going the more natural route, which I’m proud of."</p><h3>Charlotte Crosby</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/d81eb8ae-1e50-4137-996e-3a748d70e3e4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000488886063.jpg><p>Back in 2011, fresh-faced Charlotte Crosby shot to fame as one of the original cast members on MTV'S Geordie Shore.</p><p>In 2016 she first went under the knife to have a bump taken out of her nose and told Heat magazine that it was scrutiny from being on Geordie Shore that drove her to have the surgery.</p><p>She said: “It's not like I can hide it. If I'd not been on TV, I'd never have got it done. I do think [my nose] caused a lack of confidence, and you always compare yourself to other people who are on TV as well.”</p><p>During lockdown, Charlotte also hit back at trolls who commented on her enhanced pout.</p><p>Defending her lip fillers, she said: "I do not want to have a mouth that resembles an a*** hole. I don’t want to just have teeth. I want to have a nice, big, voluptuous lip.</p><p>“Now if that is such a problem to everyone else – get a grip. There’s bigger things in the world going on right now than my big lips. When are we going to stop commenting on other people’s appearance?"</p><h3>Lauren Goodger</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/e4abfe81-6b7a-4441-800f-82f7bfab1805.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1188b98c-09f2-4b6d-a0b3-17bd1b0173ee.jpg><p>Lauren has previously said she started getting lip fillers a year after TOWIE started filming in 2010.</p><p>"2016 was the year to get my lip fillers removed after nearly five years of constant top-ups," she told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>"I have lovely full natural lips so it's finally time to embrace them."</p><p>However, five months later she&nbsp;<a href=#>appeared to have decided to regain her fuller pout</a>, and she told Fabulous that&nbsp;<a href=#>"I'm not as bad as some"</a>.</p><h3>Megan Barton Hanson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ae7326dd-16ec-49db-9cc6-4aeb8a8cf097.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000631348327.jpg><p>Before entering the Love Island villa in 2018, Megan Barton Hanson told OK! that she'd had her lip fillers topped up.</p><p>Megan has previously compared getting lip filler to “getting your hair done”.</p><p>She told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a>&nbsp;magazine: “People get their hair done because it makes them feel nice.
