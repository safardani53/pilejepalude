Montreal police have arrested a man for breaking into the Laval, Quebec home of Celine Dion — where he drew a bath and raided her fridge, the BBC reports.
The 43-year-old French-Canadian singer and husband Rene Angelil were not home at the time of the bizarre break-in. According to police spokesman Franco Di Genova, local man Daniel Bedard, 36, jumped a fence and then used a garage door opener (discovered in an unlocked car) to break into the house, located just outside Montreal."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
