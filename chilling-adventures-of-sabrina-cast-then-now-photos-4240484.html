The young actress starred as Sally Draper on the Emmy-winning series&nbsp;Mad Men before she graduated to the mature role of Sabrina Spellman in 2018. As the lead of the series, Kiernan balanced first season naiveté and totally transformed into a powerful witch that no one would mess with. Though it’s sad to see her go, fans of the talented star can look forward to so much more from Kiernan in the future. She’ll star in the 2020 series Swimming with Sharks and appear opposite <strong><a href=#>Cole Sprouse</a>&nbsp;</strong>in Lizzy.<p id=content-paragraph-6><strong><strong>Ross Lynch</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-ross-lynch-embed.jpg>Like Kiernan,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Ross Lynch</strong></a> was a highly in-demand actor and singer when he was cast as Harvey Kinkle on the supernatural series. Prior to appearing on the Netflix series, <a href=#>he played Austin Moon</a> on the Disney Channel original series&nbsp;Austin & Ally&nbsp;and flexed his dramatic muscles in the film&nbsp;My Friend Dahmer about a young <strong>Jeffrey Dahmer</strong>. The multi-hyphenate talent seriously has so much potential, and we cannot wait to see what he accomplishes post-CAOS! Ross and CAOS co-star <strong>Jaz Sinclair</strong> are still head over heels in love. They started dating after meeting on the set of the show!<p id=content-paragraph-8><strong><strong>Lucy Davis</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-lucy-davis-embed.jpg>Beloved British actress&nbsp;<strong>Lucy Davis&nbsp;</strong>offered so much wit and sweetness as Sabrina’s dear Aunt Hilda. But, like her co-stars, Lucy was well established across the pond. She appeared in shows like the original The Office,&nbsp;Shaun of the Dead, and even appeared in the 2017 adaptation of&nbsp;Wonder Woman! Lucy is such an accomplished performer, and her longtime fans are surely looking forward to what she’ll do next.<p id=content-paragraph-10><strong><strong>Chance Perdomo</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-chance-perdomo-embed.jpg>Audiences fell in love with Sabrina’s dear cousin Ambrose on&nbsp;CAOS, and it’s all thanks to the actor that plays the character:&nbsp;<strong>Chance Perdomo</strong>! The young actor skyrocketed to fame on the show and became a total fan favorite thanks to his smooth style and suave personality. Chance also showed through his performance how talented he really is. He undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of him! He can be seen next in the two forthcoming After sequels. Chance will take over the role of Landon from <strong>Shane Paul McGhie</strong>.<p id=content-paragraph-12><strong><strong>Michelle Gomez</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-michelle-gomez-embed.jpg><strong>Michelle Gomez</strong> is one of&nbsp;CAOS‘s most striking performers. As Mary Wardwell/Madam Satan, Michelle pulled double-duty, playing the trustworthy teacher to Sabrina and her mortal classmates, while also devising every plan possible to turn Sabrina to the dark side and embrace the cruelty her powers could reap. Michelle made it all look so easy, but the Doctor Who alum proved that she is truly one of the brightest talents from the show. In addition to CAOS, Michelle also starred in the HBO Max series The Flight Attendant in 2020<p id=content-paragraph-14><strong><strong>Jaz Sinclair</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-jaz-sinclair-embed.jpg><strong>Jaz Sinclair&nbsp;</strong>really came into her own on&nbsp;CAOS. As Sabrina’s friend Rosalind Walker, Jaz was able to play a supportive friend and a young woman coming into her own powers. The young star was no stranger to the limelight before joining&nbsp;CAOS. In fact, the actress boasts such titles to her filmography as&nbsp;Easy, Paper Towns, and&nbsp;When the Bough Breaks. With such a stacked résumé, Jaz’s star can only rise further!<p id=content-paragraph-16><strong><strong>Miranda Otto</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-miranda-otto-embed.jpg><strong>Miranda Otto&nbsp;</strong>brought an incredible fan base with her when she was cast as Aunt Zelda on&nbsp;CAOS. The veteran Aussie actress starred in the Oscar-winning films&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&nbsp;in the early aughts. As such, playing a regal, refined, and powerful witch was the perfect part for Miranda, who brought a quick, cold wit, and elegant style to the role.<p id=content-paragraph-18><strong><strong>Lachlan Watson</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-lachlan-watson-embed.jpg><strong>Lachlan Watson</strong> quickly became a beloved cast member of&nbsp;CAOS as soon as they stepped on screen. Lachlan played Theo/ Susie Putnam, one of Sabrina’s best friends. The young star not only balanced playing a character in the supernatural world but also offered a beautiful narrative of a young person coming into their identity. Lachlan did such a beautiful job portraying a story that so many young fans could see themselves in, and Lachlan showed just how bright their future is!<p id=content-paragraph-20><strong><strong>Gavin Leatherwood</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sabrina-then-now-gavin-leatherwood-embed.jpg>At first the quintessential bad boy of the series,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Gavin Leatherwood</strong></a> quickly showed how multi-dimensional his character, Nicholas Scratch, could be! Playing Nicholas on&nbsp;CAOS was Gavin’s breakout role after appearing in short films and one-episode stints in dramatic TV series. Coincidentally,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke to Gavin about what fans could expect in the fourth and final season. “The obstacles and challenges get even crazier and more daunting,” Gavin teased for fans <a href=#>when&nbsp;<strong>HL</strong></a><a href=#> spoke to him in January</a>. “If Part 1 was the beginning of the roller coaster ride and Part 2 was the ascension, Part 3 was the drop and Part 4 is all the crazy, windy turns.”<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KhoKWkmaO0bq3Dr5ynrKWnsrR5zp9krJmSp7avrYycmKysXam1prqMp6awZaCdvLW70mZra2xgaYV1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./palmers-alisha-wainwright-praises-justin-timberlake-after-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Palmers Alisha Wainwright Praises Justin Timberlake After Scandal</span></a>
