While the risk of stroke was also lower in people who had two or three cups a day.
Chinese scientists said both drinks are rich in caffeine and plant chemicals flavonoids, which boost blood flow to the brain, reduce inflammation and attack rogue proteins."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

could be helping to save your life.</p><p>Experts have claimed that drinking tea and coffee may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s by 25 per cent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695470568.jpg><p>While the risk of stroke was also lower in people who had two or three cups a day.</p><p>Chinese scientists said both drinks are rich in caffeine and plant chemicals flavonoids, which boost blood flow to the brain, reduce inflammation and attack rogue proteins.</p><p>The survey results are based on a study of 365,682 Brits aged 50 to 74 who were monitored for 15 years.</p><p>We look at what else in your kitchen cupboard could help to stave off illnesses.</p><h2>TOMATO KETCHUP</h2><p>KETCHUP may be banned by Premier League football managers, but tomatoes contain lycopene, an anti-oxidant that helps prevent cell damage and may lower risk of heart disease.</p><p>It also appears to reduce ‘bad’ cholesterol – with a Finnish study claiming volunteers cholesterol fell in a few weeks of eating extra ketchup.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Tomato puree or canned tomatoes may be even better as they don’t contain as much sugar.</p><p>While separate studies also claim lycopene can protect against prostate cancer.</p><h2>HERBS AND SPICES</h2><p>THE little jars can be key in keeping you healthy.</p><p>It is said Turmeric can reduce your risk of cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/defb23bf-5f4a-4e96-b0f1-61ca9814db64.jpg><p>While research in Diabetes Care claims a daily tea-spoon of cinnamon can help control blood sugar in people with Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>While a teaspoon of dried oregano has the same cancer-fighting antioxidants as a serving of broccoli.</p><h2>PEANUT BUTTER</h2><p>GIRLS who eat peanut butter could reduce their risk of breast cancer in later life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472700.jpg><p>A study, published in journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, showed girls who ate peanut butter or nuts regularly aged nine to 15 were less likely to develop benign or non-cancerous breast disease by the time they turned 30.</p><p>Benign breast disease increases the risk of breast cancer.</p><h2>DARK CHOCOLATE</h2><p>EATING some dark chocolate can boost your mood and may help combat depression.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472751.jpg><p>In a 2019 study by University College London, those who reported eating dark chocolate in two 24-hour periods were 70 per cent less likely to report symptoms of depression than those who hadn’t eaten any.</p><p>Dark chocolate contains flavonoids, which are believed to protect against cancer and lift mood.</p><h2>COFFEE</h2><p>Coffee drinkers are less likely to catch Covid-19 according to new research.</p><p>Experts at Northwestern University, Chicago, said those who had one cup a day were around ten per cent less likely to catch the virus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472813.jpg><p>Tea didn’t have the same effect so researchers said it could be down to the higher caffeine content or compounds found in coffee that you don’t get in tea.</p><h2>WHOLEGRAIN BREAD</h2><p>THIS type of bread, pasta or rice contain fibre, B vita-mins, protein and antioxidants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472775.jpg><p>The British Dietetic Association claims the risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes may be up to 30 per cent lower in people who regularly eat them as part of healthy and low-fat diet.</p><p>Studies have shown they can also help users keep to a healthy weight.</p><h2>OLIVE OIL</h2><p>ONE study on mice claims that extra virgin olive oil may boost brain health and help to prevent cognitive decline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472768.jpg><p>Mice who were fed the oil on top of their normal diet per-formed better in memory and learning tests.</p><p>It is thought a diet rich in extra virgin olive oil may help fight the build-up of toxic tau proteins that are found in the brains of Alzheimer’s and some dementia patients.</p><h2>BAKED BEANS</h2><p>EVEN a humble tin of baked beans can help give you a healthy boost.</p><p>Nutritionist Aman-da Ursell explains: “Baked beans are a great source of soluble fibre, that helps balance blood sugar and cholesterol levels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472796.jpg><p>“They are also a source of good value protein, which we need to keep everything from our immune system to our skin, in good health.”</p><h2>NUTS</h2><p>Go nuts for nuts.</p><p>Regularly eating a small handful of unsalted nuts such as walnuts, almonds and pistachios significantly lowers the risk of death from heart attack and stroke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472671.jpg><p>Scientists from the Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Institute, Iran, said eating them twice a week lowers your risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 17 per cent.</p><p>It’s thought to be down to the healthy unsaturated fats they contain though they are also a good source of protein, minerals, vitamins, fibre and polyphenols, some of which are known to boost heart health.</p><h2>TINNED SALMON</h2><p>Along with sardines or mackerel they are all great sources of Vitamin D, which supports the immune system, bone strength and brain function.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695472663.jpg><p>We should get most of this ‘sunshine vitamin’ from being outdoors but that is very hard while in the UK, especially in the winter.</p><p>But choose a tin canned in water rather than oil, which can be high in fat.</p><h2>PORRIDGE</h2><p>A BOWL for breakfast can keep you feeling full, helping dieters to lose weight in studies and reducing stomach bloating.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img

of 22,000 adults found that those who ate oatmeal daily had lower body weights and slimmer waists than those who didn’t.</p><p>This could be down to the high levels of fibre they contain, which has been shown to help lower cholesterol, keeping your heart healthy.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>From stopping hot flushes to banishing the muffin top, how diet during menopause can
