Then, she turned her attention to the real showstopper: the crossover waistband.</p><p>"There's no gap," she marveled, looking at the back view of the jeans.</p><p>Then, turning to face forward, she smiled, clearly impressed by her silhouette. "I think it's snatching the waist!" she said happily.</p><p>Her viewers agreed and were eager to try the trend at home.</p><p>"They look amazing on you," one woman wrote. "I would definitely purchase these in every color available."</p><p>A few complained that the crossover waist looked like a "sewing mistake" or a "missed button."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>But along with Richards herself, the style had plenty of fans.</p><p>"I actually like the crossover waist," one woman wrote, defending the trend.
