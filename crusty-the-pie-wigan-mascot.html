And what a game! A 3-2 win!<u></u><u></u></p><p>I got a ‘pie’ five off Neil Warnock, which was good and the Cardiff City fans were really friendly.</p><p>I was in the Wigan Athletic Family Zone before the game and so many people wanted a photo with me. I didn’t realise how popular I was after my appearance on Sky Sports.</p><p><u></u><b>A pies' worst fear must be being thrown,.

What's the worst that's been aimed at you from the stands?&nbsp;</b><u></u><u></u></p><p>Oh I haven’t had that yet. The fans of Cardiff City, Leeds United and Barnsley have been great. They all want photos with me. All I have had to do is perfect my smile.<u></u></p><p><b>How have the players been? Who's given you the warmest reception? Anyone you're slightly frightened of? Did you have to sing an initiation song when you were welcomed to the club?</b><u></u></p><p>There was no initiation song!</p><p>The players have been lovely, <a href=#>as has Paul Cook</a> – the manager. I get a ‘pie’ five off the players as they warm up and walk out.</p><p>But I need to join in on a goal celebration soon though!</p><p>I have loved it, and I am enjoying my fame while it lasts."</p><p><b>Since you were launched (forgive the pun) you've won fans from all over the globe... tell us about the messages you've received.</b><u></u><u></u></p><p>It has been incredible. I have had messages from all over the world.</p><p>The club are now getting a Crusty The Pie clothing range and toys because it has been so popular.</p><p>I have loved it, and I am enjoying my fame while it lasts. ​I just wish I could meet every one of my fans and have my picture with them all, there just aren't enough hours in a day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000510482001-e1568281011110.jpg><p><b>Which mascot are you most looking forward to meeting this season and why?

I haven’t done enough to get a place in the starting XI just yet.<u></u><u></u></p><p>My movement is limited, but I think I can get my penalties ready for Boxing Day.</p><p>​I'm pretty quick in the net already, so they'd better be sure to bring their A game if they want to get past me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000515527857.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000515529763-e1568281244150.jpg><p>Admittedly, I haven't quite perfected the art of kick-ups yet, but practice will make perfect.<u></u></p><p><b>A lot of mascots love to dance... any moves you've got that'll have the home fans in raptures?</b><u></u><u></u></p><p>Hmm a dance off… I might have to think about that in the future. I’ll get my football skills perfected first and then move on to a mascot dance off.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">latest football features</h2></p><p>Maybe somebody could create that event? ​I already do love to throw some shapes, especially when "I'm a Believer" comes on, that's my favourite!</p><p>And the crowd seem to love my moves too, so even better.<u></u></p><p><b>Finally, can Crusty leave a legacy at Wigan akin to players like Andy Liddell and Jimmy Bullard?
