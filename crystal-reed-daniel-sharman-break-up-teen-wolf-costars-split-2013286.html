The actress, who plays Allison Argent on the MTV series, has split from her boyfriend and Teen Wolf costar <strong>Daniel Sharman</strong>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> caught up with the star on Thursday, June 27, at the Helmut Newton Exhibition Opening in L.A., where she dished about going to Paris to regroup after the relationship ended. "I went by myself and it was cold, but it was still really, really beautiful," she told <strong>Us</strong> of the trip. "I was just getting over a breakup, so it was something that just jumpstarted my singleness."</p><p>In the beginning, she said, it was "really lonely" and "depressing," but things got better as the trip went on. "I was lucky enough to meet the most incredible people," she told <strong>Us</strong>. "But it is the most romantic city in the world, so it can be a little isolating. You just have to make sure that you get out and walk around and do the things you always wanted to do."</p><p>"In Paris, [the night life] is so communal," she added. "It's good."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reed also revealed to https://www.usmagazine.com/ that she had found comfort in music. "My summer anthem right now is Alanis Morissette, 'Jagged Little Pill,'" she said. "Because I"m going through a breakup and I can just jam to it. It's a good record. You need something that feels empowering."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacqqmowaK4jKucnpxdma6vtcSlZKygkae6orqMm6memZtiwrF5056cp2WnpLmnecKoqq2Zoqh6tLzLoqtmamBmgHOElWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andres-palacios-19750513-html.html><span>←</span><span>Andrs Palacios (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
