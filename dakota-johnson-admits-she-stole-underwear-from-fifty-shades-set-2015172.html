Also there's part of me that's like, I don't want anyone to see this movie — just kidding."</p><p>And while Dornan visited a sex dungeon to prepare for his role of Christian Grey, Johnson revealed she didn’t do much research. “I didn't get to go to the sex dungeon,” she told the mag. "I wanted to keep myself a little bit distanced from it at first because I wanted Ana's reaction to certain things to be honest and real."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During those not-so-comfortable scenes, Johnson was also thankful for her costar, who she says was super protective.</p><p>"Jamie would be the first one to throw a blanket over me,” she said of when she’d be tied to a bed, naked after they’d yell cut. “And he did a lot of studying, just to make sure that I was as safe as possible. But there were some painful moments,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZukwaJ5yaifp6ufo3qisMyiq6xlo52ybr%2FTqKOeZaWjsaa%2B1p6Yq2WWp7yuecWina2xXai1orDErGSsnaRif3F9lGpua2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-6-ranked-goalkeepers-with-the-most-clean-sheets.html><span>←</span><span>Top 6 Ranked Goalkeepers With The Most Clean Sheets Since 2020</span></a>
