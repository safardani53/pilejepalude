"She just was a hard worker and infectious and fun and irreverent."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Noting that he "actually liked her music — I thought her music was cool," the Grammy Award winner continues, "I don't know how to make that kind of music, but she loved that music, and she made us love it too. So I appreciated her as an artist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Foster: "It's a hell of a burden to carry around, to be Elvis' daughter, and I think she wore it really well. I mean, obviously, the struggles that she had are well documented, but who knows what it was like to walk in her shoes? ... She was iconic in her own right."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Araya Doheny/Getty for The Music Center</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Foster previously had a relationship with Lisa Marie's father's ex, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Linda Thompson</a>, who dated "The King" <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>from 1972 to 1976</a>. Foster and Thompson, 72, meanwhile, were married from 1991 to 2005.

The pair had two kids together, Brandon and Brody, before separating in 1986.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an exclusive statement to PEOPLE, Thompson explained that she was "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>absolutely devastated and shocked</a>" to learn about Lisa Marie's death.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was so happy to see her at Graceland to celebrate what would have been Elvis's 88th birthday, and then, of course, at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Golden Globes</a>," Thompson added of her former love's daughter, who she first met as a young girl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Want to get the biggest stories from PEOPLE every weekday?</strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1><strong> Subscribe to our new podcast</strong></a><strong>, PEOPLE Every Day, to get the essential celebrity, entertainment and human interest news stories Monday through Friday.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lisa Marie Presley.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Joe Scarnici/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She seemed to be on a more positive trajectory emotionally after the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>unfathomable loss of her beloved son, Benjamin</a>," continued Thompson, referencing the tragic July 2020 suicide of Lisa Marie's late son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Benjamin Keough</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lisa and I kept in touch off & on for all these years — most recently by text. In fact, the very last text to me was a simple 'Love you Linda' with a heart emoji," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lisa Marie was so much like her daddy it was uncanny," Thompson, who first met Elvis shortly after he separated from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Priscilla Presley</a>, then said. "She had his deep, soulful eyes, his pouty lip, and his raucous, irreverent sense of humor. She was a beautiful contradiction like Elvis… complicated in her simplicity. She was brutally honest, straightforward, loving and loyal. I don't think there was a phony cell in her body. I believe she lived her life authentically."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thompson also paid her respects on Instagram Thursday, sharing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">an image of Elvis holding his young daughter</a> with the caption: "My heart is too heavy for words…💔😥." (Lisa Marie, an artist in her own capacity, released three studio albums that included vocal, production, and songwriting collaborations with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Pink</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Linda Perry</a> and Glenn Ballard.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Lisa Marie Presley, Daughter of Elvis and Priscilla, Dead at 54: 'The Most Strong and Loving Woman'</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Foster also paid tribute to another music star during the event on Saturday evening — Jerry Moss, the recording executive who co-founded A&M Records along with trumpet player and bandleader Herb Alpert.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This guy Jerry has been such a beacon in my life, but I think for thousands [as well] because he has that ability to be a beacon for so many people and every artist on A&M Records," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Of course, Herb was there as well, but [with] Jerry ... this calmness that he always displayed was just amazing, and he just is a tastemaker," Foster continued. "It's been just a blessing to have him in my life, and then later on in my life, we got to be real friends, which I just love because I've looked up to him so much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"No matter who you talk to, you know, nobody's gonna say he was an a------, because he just wasn't. I happen to be one of those guys that thinks that the music business is full of good people, it's not full of bad people, but I think Jerry is like in the upper echelon of kindness, you know?" he added. "Because it's a tough business, it's a grind."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He never made it feel like a grind, he just always just stayed calm and collected and just presented himself so beautifully," Foster concluded.
