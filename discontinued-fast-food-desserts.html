While most fast food empires have created successful menus based on their burgers or chicken sandwiches, there’s nothing like a sweet treat to bite into once you’re done with your meal.
From Wendy’s Frostys to McDonald’s McFlurries, these desserts can take a restaurant’s menu to the next level.
Unfortunately for customers, four chains have discontinued some iconic sweet treats over the past several years."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

ARBY’S CHOCOLATE TURNOVER</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/bittersweet-ending-xxx-fast-food-829336189.jpg><p>While many are familiar with apple and cherry turnovers as a classic sweet breakfast treat, Arby’s upped the ante when it launched a Chocolate Turnover on its menu.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about fast food">Read more about fast food</h2><p>Today, cherry and apple still are offered, but the chocolate creation has been out of stock since 2016.</p><p>Arby’s reportedly discontinued the chocolate turnover to make room for a new dessert line of cookies, but fans of the turnover were displeased.</p><p>Today, there’s still a Change.org petition with hundreds of signatures hoping to bring back the item to the menu.</p><p>“I have been craving them for months and nothing suffices,” one customer wrote on the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">petition</a>. “I haven't gone to Arby's ever since.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Another fan wrote on Twitter: “We all know Subway has the best cookies, so don’t even try! Stick to what you know.”</p><p>Arby’s has never responded to the public outcry, however, so it’s unlikely the turnover will make a return anytime soon.</p><h2>2. CARL’S JR DING DONG ICE CREAM SANDWICH</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/bittersweet-ending-xxx-fast-food-829335987.jpg><p>Another beloved chocolatey treat that mysteriously vanished from menus was Carl Jr’s Ding Dong Ice Cream Sandwich.</p><p>It was a dessert of creative minds, starting with the Ding Dong Hostess treat with vanilla ice cream packed in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p>And best of all, it only cost around $2.00 for one.</p><p>While the dessert brought in considerable praise when it launched in 2015, it couldn’t stay around forever.</p><p>It disappeared a few months later, and now Carl’s Jr customers have to choose between the more traditional shakes, cookies, chocolate cake, and cheesecake.</p><p>Some speculate that perhaps the Ding Dong Ice Cream Sandwich was just a little too sugary to stay on menus long term.</p><p>“The dense ice cream pairs well with the (also pretty dense) chocolate cake, yet both together are so sweet that, about halfway through, there is a bit of sugar fatigue,” one reviewer wrote on <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The Impulsive Buy</a>.</p><h2>3. MCDONALD’S CHERRY PIE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/www-facebook-com-mcdonaldsguam-photos-825216497.jpg><p>While McDonald’s still sells its traditional Apple Pie, some fans are upset the Cherry Pie version is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The dessert disappeared in 2013 after decades on the menu.</p><p>That’s not to say there was never controversy surrounding the Cherry Pies – a 1979 WRTV investigative report found the pies didn’t contain enough cherries to actually be labeled a “cherry pie.”</p><p>However, this didn’t keep fans from gobbling up the sweet treat alongside McDonald’s burgers and chicken nuggets.</p><p>“I miss the molten-y fried cherry pies of my youth,” one customer wrote on Reddit.</p><p>The Cherry Pie is believed to be discontinued due to low sales.</p><p>One former McDonald’s employee said at their local store, 30 apple pies would be sold a day while only four cherry pies would ever make it out of the kitchen.</p><p>Moving forward, the chain has decided to focus on its more popular dessert creations.</p><h2>4. BURGER KING BACON SUNDAE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/burger-kings-bacon-sundae-19012251.jpg><p>While <a href=#>Burger King</a> is still known for its innovative offerings like Chicken Fries, nothing made a splash in the fast food world quite like its Bacon Sundae.</p><p>It was made with basic soft-serve vanilla ice cream, but the topping is what really differentiated it from competitors in the market.</p><p>The sundae was only available for a limited time in 2012, and during its tenure, it brought in mixed reviews.</p><p>While some adored the sweet and salty combination, others abhorred the idea of eating bacon inside their ice cream dessert.</p><p>“As I continued to chew, the bacon came through,” one reviewer wrote of the menu item on <a href=#>HuffPost</a>.</p><p>“It was crunchy, salty and smoky. I kind of wished the bacon wasn't there, but I didn't hate it. As I continued to eat it, I enjoyed the Bacon Sundae more and more.”</p><p>However, other customers warned against ordering the item due to quality issues.</p><p>“I had a bad experience getting this one, the bacon was old and soggy and the cashier that handed it to me said ‘ew that nasty’ so it kind of ruined the experience,” one Redditor wrote.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In other discontinued dessert news, fans have been begging for an <a href=#>iconic Reese’s candy</a> to make a comeback.</p><p>Plus, Cheerios discontinued a <a href=#>popular cereal flavor</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbYJygJFwcGicmaiwsLrToqWunZRis6K%2F02adqKeUYrGmv9Keqa2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-de-leon.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Kevin de Len net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
