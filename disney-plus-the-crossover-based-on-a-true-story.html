Despite the struggle, Kwame never gave up on his baby.</p><p>“Because it had been rejected 22 times and then eventually got published and won the Newbery Medal, I began to learn how to embrace the no's. I was 'OK, bring on the no's. Bring them on,'" Kwame said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KGET-TV</a>.</p><p>"You know that once all the no's have come to your party, eaten all your food and then gone home, what is left is the yes."</p><p>"It took six years to find a publisher. I heard no's everywhere. And somewhere in my head, I said, 'This is a good book, Kwame. You’ve got to believe in it. You’ve got to say yes to yourself,'" he said.</p><p>His previous rejections prepared him in case of more pushback when it came to creating a TV series adaptation. To his surprise, the executives with Disney Branded Television adored his ideas.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It’s about these kids being told no after having been told ‘yes’ all their life on the court, off the court, with their crush, in school. And, so, my journey with this book is really a metaphor for this TV series and where we are trying to go,” Kwame shared.</p><p>He credits series writers Damani Johnson and Kimberly Harrison with elevating The Crossover while still staying true to the source material.</p><p>According to KGET-TV, the series's writers focused on Kwame's "use of language, rhythm, rhyme, metaphor, and simile" to adapt his work.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>As he highlighted the importance of believing in your own abilities, Kwame pointed to a powerful Walt Disney quote.</p><p>“I believed in it. I believed in it. I love quotations. Walt Disney said, ‘If you believe in a thing, believe in it implicitly, unquestionably.’ I believed in the project. I believed in the book. I knew poetry like the back of my hand. I know how kids talk," he said.</p><p>Kwame Alexander makes no space for self-doubt. Back off, inner saboteur!</p><p>The Crossover is currently streaming on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0usSyZKmkpah6tbTEZpqrp6OovLex0WaZmquVmXqwuoyaZK2qpZp6tMDOq7A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sister-wives-has-the-family-moved-to-coyote-pass.html><span>←</span><span>Has the Family Moved to Coyote Pass?</span></a>
