The charges were revealed in Monday’s episode of Secrets of Playboy, an A&E docuseries that focuses on the dark secrets of Hugh Hefner’s Playboy company.&nbsp;During the show, former “bunny mother” P.J. Masten said that Soul Train founder P.J. Masten was a Playboy VIP and a well-known figure in the mansion.</p><p>Cornelius apparently saw two new recruits one night and invited them to join him in the VIP area before inviting them to a secret party at his home, according to Masten. However, the girls were said to have gone missing for three days:</p><p>“These two young girls got into his Rolls-Royce and drove up to his home; we didn’t hear from them for three days.” “We had no idea where they were.”</p><p>She stated that three days later, one of the girls contacted the mansion for assistance, claiming that they were being detained against their will at Cornelius’ home. Joe Piastro, Playboy’s chief of security, rushed to rescue the females and allegedly found them “bloodied, bruised, and drugged.”</p><p></p><p>According to the rabbit’s mother, the girls were reportedly held in different rooms for three days and abused, tormented, and molested. She further stated that, in accordance with Playboy policy, no legal action was taken and that the incident was handled internally.&nbsp;According to reports, the girls were told to keep silent and avoid any interaction with the press. Cornelius died in 2012, about a decade ago, and the current charges are nearly a decade old.</p><h2>The reason of death of Don Cornelius was investigated.</h2><p>Don Cornelius started his career in show business in 1966, when he joined Chicago radio station WVON as an announcer, news reporter, and disc jockey. He eventually became the anchor of A Black’s View of the News on WCIU-TV before launching Soul Train in 1970.&nbsp;With the program, the media personality earned enormous popularity and went on to become a television superstar. He was also recognized for introducing African-American performers such as Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Marvin Gaye, among others, to a wider audience.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Don-Cornelius-3.jpg alt="Don Cornelius " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cornelius was discovered injured with a gunshot wound at his Mulholland Drive house on February 1, 2012, after police officers responded to a report of a shooting incident. He was brought to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was declared dead.&nbsp;The TV producer died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner. Don Cornelius was suffering from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, according to former Soul Train DJ Shemar Moore, and his health was deteriorating before to his death.</p><p>Cornelius had had an aneurysm almost 15 years before his death, which led him to experience seizures, according to the autopsy report. According to reports, the issue occurred after he had complex 21-hour brain surgery in 1982 to treat a congenital abnormality in his cerebral arteries. According to Don Cornelius’ autopsy report, about 3:00 a.m. on February 1, 2012, the 75-year-old contacted his son and said, “I don’t know how long I can take this,” before turning the revolver on himself. Tony Cornelius, his son, discovered him comatose in a chair later.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Don-Cornelius-4.jpg alt="Don Cornelius " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Masten accuses Don Cornelius of assault; Tony reacts</h2><p>Former “bunny mommy” P.J. Masten said in the latest installment of the Secrets of Playboy docuseries that Don Cornelius reportedly abused two young girls almost two decades ago. She further said that the crime was kept from the public eye:</p><p>“It was perhaps the most gruesome tale I’d ever heard at Playboy.” This is the tale of a big cleaning that was never reported in the media.”</p><p>Masten expressed her outrage that Cornelius was never prosecuted for his alleged actions:</p><p>“What was so shocking to me, what made me so upset, was that no charges were filed, and Don Cornelius’ powers as a number one VIP were never terminated.” The next week, he was back in the club.”</p><p></p><p>Masten even criticized herself for not bringing up the topic at the time. Cornelius’ son responded to the charges by telling People that the accusations were “salacious” and the disclosure was a “unbelievable narrative without genuine evidence.”&nbsp;In the meanwhile, the Secrets of Playboy docuseries published an on-screen warning alerting viewers that “the great majority of the claims” made on the program “have not been the subject of criminal investigations or charges” and “do not constitute evidence of guilt.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Don Cornelius</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Television producer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibqKZdmLyzusSloK6rXayutHnAnJquq5WZerCyjJqqrJmlocGqusZmq7CnXa68trrGZq6opZWjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katrina-kat-tat-jackson-kids.html><span>←</span><span>'BIC' Star Talks Motherhood (EXCLUSIVE)</span></a>
