That is because this interview was done by Jesse Garon Presley.”&nbsp;wrote one commenter.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve seen this before I knew it was Jesse and not Elvis as he was not comfortable,” a second fan echoed.</p><p>“I noticed that too,” a third wrote. “I also noticed that Jesse could not answer all of the questions about the events in Elvis’ life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Obviously, this theory’s got more holes than a lesbian gangbang, beginning with the fact that Elvis wasn’t born famous, which means there would have been no reason to hide his brother for use as a future stand-in.</p><p>But let’s play nutjob’s advocate for a bit and pretend Jesse actually spent his life filling in as Counterfeit Elvis:</p><p>If he were making appearances on his brother’s behalf as early as 1970, couldn’t that mean Elvis actually died way earlier than we thought, and it was Jesse who lost his life in that Memphis filling station in ’77?</p><p>We think it’s time to face facts, Elvis truthers:</p><p>Despite all of your compelling “evidence” (His name is an anagram for “lives!”) Elvis left the building a very long time ago,</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WCcLHLr6CsZaCnsrS4xLJknKeeqL2qvsCcsGampam3sK7SZqqasV2ptabFjKGYr51dpb%2Bwu8Vmn56rXajBqrjLZpho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-island.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Love Island Season 1 Episode 1: Episode 1</span></a>
