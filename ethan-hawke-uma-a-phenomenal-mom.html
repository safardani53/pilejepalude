And it had nothing to do with her. Nothing to do with her,” Hawke, 36, says with a shake of his head.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hawke says he considers being father to his two children with Thurman – daughter Maya, 8, and son Levon, 4 – “the greatest pleasure in my life. It’s the only role that, if I fail, I will consider my life a failure.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Having had parents who divorced, Hawke is aware of how such a split affects the kids. Speaking of himself and Thurman, he says, “Our burden is just getting along, not hurting each other’s feelings, and letting each other grow – letting the tides take our lives away from each other and dealing with the disappointment of a dream that didn’t happen.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to speaking about Thurman, also 36, Hawke takes the high road, says the magazine. “She’s my children’s mother,” he says. “You have to keep that above anything else. If you bring two people into the world together, that supersedes anything else.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He also says about her devotion to raising the children properly, “She’s a great mother, and raising the kids is a priority for both of us. We’re so fortunate that we have each other’s back in that way. Because I write and act in theater, it’s a lot easier for me to stay in the city. But my ex-wife has done a phenomenal job of that as well. She plans all her movies to shoot in New York.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for sharing parental duties with Thurman in the big city, Hawke adds, “We live down the street from each other. If we lived down the street from each other in Minneapolis, I’d have to watch every car go in and out of the driveway. I’d know how late she stayed out. I don’t have to know any of that stuff.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeVqbWiuoyhmLCjlWLCrq2MmmSpoJWjvK6xzZqjZqWfonw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-radcliffe-nude-straddling-a-horse.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel Radcliffe: Nude, Straddling a Horse</span></a>
