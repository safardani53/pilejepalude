The supporters' slogan — referring to Tranmere Rovers FC's shirt colour — had been in the stands at the club's Prenton Park ground for months.
But officials decided to cover it up ahead of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lionesses' televised 6-0 win over Russia in a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday.
Hours earlier England player Lucy Bronze had posted a picture of the banner on Instagram as the squad trained on the pitch before kick-off."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
