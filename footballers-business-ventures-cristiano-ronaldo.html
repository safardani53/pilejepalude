For me, it's fundamental."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673581442-1.jpg><h2>LUKAS PODOLSKI</h2><p>Ex-Arsenal star Podolski is in the twilight years of his career, recently joining Polish side Gornik Zabrze at the age of 36.</p><p>To supplement his income when he eventually calls it a day, the German star has turned to kebabs.</p><p>He has six shops under the chain name Mangal, with four in Cologne.</p><p>And he expanded to Bonn, where he also has an ice cream parlour, pub and clothes store.</p><img

HAREWOOD</h2><p><a href=#>The ex-West Ham centre forward</a> always had a bit of an engine on him as a player.</p><p>Which is funny because now he's into car customisation with AC13 Premier - delivering bespoke motors to football's elite.</p><p>His impressive client list includes Harry Kane, Kyle Walker and&nbsp;Andy Carroll&nbsp;among many others in the football world as well as England cricketer Stuart Broad and former super middleweight world champion boxer Carl Froch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424545426.jpg><h2>LEE BOWYER</h2><p><a href=#>Fishing isn't something you'd associate</a> with Birmingham City manager and former Leeds hardman Bowyer.</p><p>But it's something he loved so much, he thought he'd buy a carp lake for punters to enjoy.</p><p>He opened up Etang De Bows to punters in 2015.</p><p>Following on from its success, he added another site in 2016 with the acquisition of one of Europe’s leading Big Fish venues – Lac Des Lesmont.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000003027350.jpg><h2>GENNARO GATTUSO</h2><p>There's nothing fishy about AC Milan legend Gattuso's side line.</p><p>The ex-midfield general, who recently turned down the Spurs job, opened up a fish shop in 2010 with much fanfare, including guest customers Ronaldinho and David Beckham.</p><p>"Someone might even smile at it, but this fish store is a dream come true for me," Gattuso proudly revealed.</p><p>"I wanted to become a fisherman when I was a child, but life’s events have later driven me in different directions."</p><p>It has since become a fine restaurant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673583451.jpg> <img

played.</p><p>After all, he's a presenter for Homes Under the Hammer and has become an expert about flipping homes over the years.</p><p>But perhaps the greatest thing he ever did was create a new musical instrument.</p><p>Dublin invented The Dube, a percussion instrument that's even been used by Stevie Wonder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2d9579b9-8cf3-49b9-9d74-be17e37d819a.jpg><h2>DANIEL AGGER</h2><p><a href=#>Ex-Liverpool star Daniel Agger</a> always loved tattoos and boasts around 21 on his body.</p><p>So, it was no surprise when he retired from the game he joined forces with his brother in Copenhagen for a tattoo parlour called Tattoodo.</p><p>He also helped launch a company in 2013 called KloAgger, putting £450,000 into a firm that manages sewage systems in Denmark.</p><p>You could hardly say Agger's career has gone down the toilet.</p><img

FLAMINI</h2><p>Before retiring, Flamini went from pro footballer to environmental entreprenuer.</p><p>The ex-Gunner is a co-founder of&nbsp;GF Biochemicals, the first company in the world able to mass-produce&nbsp;levulinic acid.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>"We founded GFBiochemicals with the ambition of finding sustainable alternatives to oil-based products," he revealed.</p><p>Flamini is also part of the Environmental Excellence Committee for the candidature of Paris as the location for the&nbsp;2024 Summer Olympics.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>It has been predicted that Flamini's company could be worth billions in years to come.</p><img
