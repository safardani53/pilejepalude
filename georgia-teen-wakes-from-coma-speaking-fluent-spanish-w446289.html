It was a sequence of things I’d never seen before. You thought you might lose him. I thought I might lose him there.”</p><p>Nsemoh was immediately taken to Atlanta Medical Center, where he spent three days in a coma in the intensive-care unit. When the student athlete finally awoke, he spoke only in Spanish, a language his parents said he’d never spoken fluently prior to the accident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“My friends would always talk to me in Spanish and would teach me,” he told <a href=#>WSB Radio</a>.</p><p>Eventually, Nsemoh’s Spanish became less fluent and he began speaking English again. “Sometimes I daze out. Sometimes I feel like I’m not there, but I am,” he explained to WSB-TV.</p><p>Despite the accident and the bizarre aftermath, Nsemoh says he’s ready to return to the soccer field. “It’s my passion. It’s the one thing I want to do for my career,” he told WSB Radio. “This can happen even at practice. And if kids already have two concussions or three, it’s recommended that they wear [a helmet].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the meantime, the teenager’s parents, Dora and Emmanuel Nsemoh, and friends started a <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> page to help with medical costs.
