On Saturday, Nov. 12, the 42-year-old supermodel — who recently divorced from Tampa Bay Buccaneer’s quarterback husband, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a>, 45 — was spotted out to dinner with her jiu-jitsu instructor,<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Joaquim Valente</a></strong>, 34, at Koji restaurant in Costa Rica. However, nine months before photos were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>published by Page Six</a> of their casual dinner date, which included Gisele’s two children <strong>Benjamin</strong>, 12, and <strong>Vivienne</strong>, 9, she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a video</a> with her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>20 million Instagram</a> of the two sparring in a friendly jiu-jitsu match at the Valente family training facility in Miami, Florida.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>caption to the video</a>, which has gotten over 430,000 likes since it was posted in February, Gisele wrote, “I believe the more tools we have in our toolbox the better. I feel stronger, more confidence, and empowered since I started practicing self-defense. I feel it’s an important skill for all, but especially for us women. Thank you <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@ValenteBrothers</a> for being awesome teachers and for making training so much fun. I am looking forward to keep improving. Let’s go!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In the video, Gisele displayed her serious Jiu-Jitsu skills<span>. In shot after shot, the beauty could be seen tossing Joaquim around. In one shot, she even flipped him upside down and, in another shot, she got him into a headlock. In the entire video, the two looked friendly with each other, as she was smiling and laughing while taking him down. So, who exactly is Joaquim? As </span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a><span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> reported</a>, Joaquim is a Miami-based martial arts expert that comes from a family of Jūjutsu practitioners. According to a Valente family website, he is also well-educated and is part owner of the Valente family facility in Miami, where Gisele had been living with her ex-husband since 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, Gisele’s friendship with Joaquim started before the two were captured <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sparring on video</a>. In an interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Dust magazine</a>, Gisele revealed that Joaquim had been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>teaching her kids</a> the sport before she got involved. “I have always been a seeker and curious person who always wants to dive deeper. It’s actually because of my son that I met Joaquim. I have a friend who told me about the Valente brothers and their martial art school, and since I wanted to steer my almost teenage son in the right direction, I thought he might be interested in it,” Gisele said in the interview with Dust.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>She added, “Initially, I wasn’t even considering it for myself, to be honest with you. But, when I bought [Ben] into the first class, and started talking with Joaquim, I realized it was much more than self-defense.” In the article, Gisele revealed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that her daughter</a>, <strong>Vivian</strong>, 9, also got into Jiu-Jitsu. After the photos of Gisele and Joaquim went viral,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> E! news reported</a> that the two were not dating. “Any suggestion that Gisele’s relationship with Joaquim Valente is anything other than strictly platonic and professional is just ridiculous.&nbsp; This is not just completely false—it’s absurd,” a source told the outlet — adding that the two of them were joined by a large group of people that were seemingly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cropped out of the photos</a>.&nbsp; <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> reached out to a rep for Gisele regarding her dinner with Joaquim, but we have not heard back yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BtZqCho5q5pnnBrqWdm5iau262zpqorqGdYsOiuMSnq55lmp7CbrbIraquZaaesaa7jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-pickl.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley Pickl- Biography, Age, Net worth, Height, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
