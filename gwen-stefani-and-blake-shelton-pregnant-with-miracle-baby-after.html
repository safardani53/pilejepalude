And some believe that there’s one already on its way.</p><p>It’s reported that Stefani, now 48 years young, recently got pregnant with a "miracle baby" thanks to IVF treatments.</p><p>Gwen and Blake’s whirlwind romance began on The Voice, as fans of the show and <a href=#>celebrity gossip</a> are well aware.</p><p>After Gwen split with now-ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, she confided in her fellow judges what was happening in her life.</p><p>In some ways, she wanted to give her NBC co-stars a heads up before reporters started asking them questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In others, she probably just needed to talk to some people, which is understandable considering what she was living through</p><p>Allegedly, Gavin was cheating on Gwen with the nanny.</p><p>Stefani is believed to have accidentally this discovered thanks to a tablet device that was linked to other devices.</p><p>That must have been a very rude awakening.</p><p>According to Gwen, it was after she shared her personal pain with her fellow judges that Blake Shelton confided in her as well.</p><p>He had just been through a similar ordeal in his personal life, having gone through a painful split from Miranda Lambert.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>After that, one thing led to another, and Gwen and Blake became inseparable – and have stayed that way for several years now.</p><p>Seriously, who could’ve seen that coming?</p><p>Since the inception of their relationship, given how intensely devoted they seem to be to each other, a lot of fans have been wondering:</p><p><strong>Will these two have a baby together?!</strong></p><p>Well, according to an article in OK, <a href=#>Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton</a>&nbsp;secretly got married "a few days" before Christmas in 2017.</p><p>In that same report is a claim that the mother of three has, after months of IVF treatments, conceived Blake Shelton’s child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Per the article, those few in whom they’ve confided this news are thrilled for them and are over the moon that they’re expecting.</p><p>Some fans point to Gwen’s recent look while (deliberately, above) sliding on a frozen pond as proof, since her outfit is decidedly puffy.</p><p>Like, say, the sort of outfit that might hide a baby bump?</p><p>Certainly, it’s appeared for a while that <a href=#>Gwen and Blake are "focused" on getting pregnant</a>, as there’s not a moment to lose.</p><p>At their ages – Gwen, as we said earlier, is 48 and Blake is 41 – time is not necessarily on their side at this stage of their lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>At one point, it seemed that <a href=#>Blake was trying to get Gwen pregnant</a>, but it’s not always clear when he’s joking and when he’s serious.</p><p>So … is the pop superstar really, after months or even years of speculation, finally pregnant with the country crooner’s baby?</p><p>Well, for one thing, Gossip Cop says it’s false. We don’t know for sure, of course, but here are some reasons to doubt it.</p><p>For starters, nobody seems to be able to find any record of the two of them having tied the knot, before Christmas or at any other time.</p><p>Which casts doubt on the rest of the report.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Even the image to which some fans point as confirmation of the report – the sight of Gwen wearing a puffy jacket – is hardly evidence.</p><p>She’s a tiny little 5-foot-6 woman from California, and it’s cold enough outside that even Blake Shelton can walk on the ice.</p><p>Of course she’s wearing a huge, puffy jacket. If she didn’t, she’d freeze. This is winter. It’s not a conspicuous fashion choice.</p><p>Now, on the flip side, that does not by any means indicate that Blake and Gwen aren’t trying to have a baby these days.</p><p>Sure, Blake might have been joking about hoping to knock up Gwen – or he might have been serious all along. Or both.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani: 11 Most Adorable PDA Moments</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>And yes, Gwen is 48, but some women get pregnant and give birth at 50. It happens sometimes, more often than ever.</p><p>Even though it’s not necessarily something that doctors would recommend, she could very well be preganant again.</p><p>But let’s not read too much into puffy outfits is all. Surely, Blake and Gwen will tell the world when they’re ready.</p><p>If they’re ever ready.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2FcLPWnqVmq6Sas6K6yGaYp5xdl7mit8RmqqGdnKm8r3nPq5ygppGjwW7DyK2fZqWZp66kuMRmmZqaqWKup8DEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pa-salieu-was-sentenced-to-2-years-and-9-months-in-prison-for-the-mass-brawl.html><span>←</span><span>Pa Salieu Was Sentenced To 2 Years And 9 Months In Prison For The Mass Brawl</span></a>
