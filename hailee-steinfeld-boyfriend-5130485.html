The actress, 26, began making movie and TV appearances as a kid, but one of her biggest roles was the 2010 film&nbsp;True Grit,&nbsp;which she was nominated for an Academy Award for. The actress has also been featured in tons of other major movies, including the MCU in the&nbsp;Hawkeye&nbsp;series on Disney+,&nbsp;Transformers’ Bumblebee&nbsp;movie, and the&nbsp;Pitch Perfect&nbsp;films.

She’s dated a few major stars over the years, but most recently, she’s been linked to&nbsp;Buffalo Bills quarterback<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Josh Allen,</a>&nbsp;</strong>27. While neither of them have publicly spoken about their relationship, they’ve been seen together on a few occasions.

The two of them first sparked dating rumors when they were spotted on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>what appeared to be a date</a> in New York City. The QB appeared to be affectionate with her, although it wasn’t clear at the time if the two were on a date. While Hailee mostly keeps her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>personal life out of the spotlight</a>, a source close to her said that they were ” getting to know each other” to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;in June 2023. Another insider had told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>outlet</a> that they were “having fun” in May. Two months after they were first seen together, Hailee was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> spotted making out</a> with Josh while they vacationed in Mexico on a Fourth of July vacation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Josh</a> has been a Buffalo Bills player since 2018. After his first season, he was named team captain in 2019. He’s been a starting QB ever since, and he’s led the Bills to great seasons, and he’s made the Pro Bowl twice. He was also very <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>supportive of his teammate</a> <strong>Damar Hamlin </strong>after his terrifying on-field collapse at the beginning of 2023. Prior to being spotted with Hailee, he had dated former college cheerleader <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brittany Williams</a>&nbsp;</strong>from 2015 to 2023.</p><h2>Niall Horan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hailee-steinfeld-and-boyfriend-josh-allen-mega-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Years before she was spotted with Josh, Hailee had a brief romance with former One Direction member <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Niall Horan,</a>&nbsp;</strong>29. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Relationship rumors</a> about the actress dating the “Slow Hands” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>singer</a> were first started in early 2018. While Hailee said she wanted to keep her relationship “private” in a January 2018 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>,&nbsp;the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pair were spotted kissing</a> while out together in August of that year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Unfortunately, the pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ended up breaking up</a> that December. A year after their split, Hailee did release a song reflecting on the breakup with the title <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Wrong Direction,”</a> seeming to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reference her ex’s boy band past</a>. The song goes into the “gut-wrenching” breakup between the two. “I just hate all the hurt that you put me through,” she sings at one point.</p><h2>Cameron Smoller</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Hailee’s<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> first public romance</a> was with influencer <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cameron Smoller</a>.&nbsp;</strong>The pair made their red carpet debut in 2017 at an event for the&nbsp;Golden Globes, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. They ended up splitting later that year. Besides being an influencer, Cameron is also the Chief of Staff for the media company Gamma, per his&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8eaoKWdlWLAtbHIp52epJRir7DFxaugnqaUYoJyf49tb25n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pros-and-their-spouses-a-complete-guide.html><span>←</span><span>'Dancing With the Stars' Pros and Their Spouses: A Complete Guide</span></a>
