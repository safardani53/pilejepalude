South Kesteven District Council has snapped up 12 properties on a posh newbuild estate - but locals believe they should have been prioritised.
Residents living in rural Langtoft, Lincs, say there is 'an outcry' over the plans to house families fleeing war-torn countries on the £1.8million estate.&nbsp;
The council has bought 12 houses in the village, where property prices average £400,000, to provide housing for Afghani and Ukrainian refugees."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
