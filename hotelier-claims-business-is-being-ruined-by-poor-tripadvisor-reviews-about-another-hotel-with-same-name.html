People who have had a positive experience tend not to comment.</p><p>"The people who put reviews on our site reflect the minority. I would say they are less than 0.1 per cent of the people we have accommodated.</p><p>"We have a number of hotels in Blackpool, and take 5,000 to 10,000 reservations a year, so we are bringing a lot of footfall to Blackpool."</p><p>A spokeswoman for TripAdvisor said: "While such an occurrence is rare, if an owner believes a review posted on their property was intended for a different establishment they can report it to us and our content team will investigate.</p><p>"As part of that investigation, we will contact the reviewer in question and ask them to confirm that their review was submitted to the correct property.</p><p>"If no confirmation is received from the reviewer, we take action to remove the review.</p><p>"This process has led to the removal of a number of reviews from the property page of The Albany."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn93fJVsaWign6myrbXEq2ScpJGeurR5wa6qoqaVqMButdJmmZ6hnpx6s8HIp5ydZZKuerG7zqtkraqZpa6lwsispqtloprDqrHWrGSamp%2BqwW6tzairoZ2iYrWwwMSlZLChpJ16tK3MnmSnmZ2afA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./franz-beckenbauer.html><span>←</span><span>Franz Beckenbauer Biography</span></a>
