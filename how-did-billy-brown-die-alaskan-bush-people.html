"Mom has actually been the stone — she's been the strongest, to be honest. I have broken down a couple of times in tears and stuff."</p><p>To distract themselves from Billy's death, Bear said the family focused on rebuilding the North Star Ranch, where most responsibility has fallen on Ami's shoulders.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It was always Da and Mom planning things like the new barn, and so now Mom basically has that on her shoulders," he told the outlet. "We try and help and stuff, but I'm not really much of a numbers, building guy."</p><p>Bear continued, "But it's kind of nice having so much to do, to be honest, because it's honoring Da as well. It was literally his last wish, his final dream, to continue building up the ranch and get it sustainable for generations of Browns to come — somewhere you can just live and not really depend on other people, except for your family."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2aamaG5unnBq6awpl2ZtqZ5wKWYrKORo3qjwdKhZKmdn6W5pg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihanna-weight-gain-thick-pic.html><span>←</span><span>[PICS] Rihanna Weight Gain?
