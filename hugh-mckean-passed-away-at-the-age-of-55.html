Colorado House Republicans announced the news on Sunday with the following statement:</p><p>“It is with profound regret that we announce the unexpected death of House Minority Leader Hugh McKean.” Hugh was devoted to promoting the best of Colorado and will be sorely missed. Funeral arrangements are being arranged, and details will be released after they are completed.”</p><h2>Hugh McKean’s death</h2><p>Hugh McKean died of acute myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, according to the Larimer County Coroner’s Office. The cause of death was determined to be natural after a forensic examination.&nbsp;According to Hugh’s deputy chief of staff, Roger Hudson, McKean was moaning with discomfort on the left side of his body, which might have been caused by the injury he had while working at his home.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hugh-McKean-1.jpg alt="Hugh McKean" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hugh’s discomfort worsened by Sunday morning, according to Hudson and Rep. Colin Larson, when he phoned his companion Amy Parks to his residence. When Parks got to McKean’s home, she saw an ambulance outside. More information is still sought on the subject.&nbsp;Larson expressed her sorrow at McKean’s passing, saying he was a good friend and that he will be missed. He went on,</p><p>“I still can’t believe he’s gone.” And my heart hurts for Amy, his son and daughter, and Amy’s children. He was a wonderful father who was always talking about his children. I hope they are aware of this.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It is with great sadness we announce the sudden passing of House Minority Leader Hugh McKean. Hugh was fiercely passionate about serving the great state of Colorado and will be missed dearly. Funeral services are being planned and details will be made public once finalized. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Yw7ARMTnJv</a></p><p>— Colorado House Republicans (@COHouseGOP) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 30, 2022</a></p><p>Colorado Democratic State Senator Kerry Donovan voiced her sorrow as well, saying,</p><p>“That’s terrible news about @hmckean. All those who were closest to him are in my thoughts. We always ended up laughing about something, no matter what the subject or disagreement was. That will be missed.”</p><h2>All About Hugh McKean</h2><p>McKean, who was born on October 27, 1967, was elected to represent Colorado House District 51 in November 2016.&nbsp;Along with other measures, he supported proposals to improve transportation in Northern Colorado and aid the County government in natural disaster recovery, including making changes to a statute governing County Sheriff training requirements.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hugh-McKean-2.jpg alt="Hugh McKean" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>McKean began his tenure in Loveland after being elected to the Loveland City Council in 2009. He demanded responsibility, battled for his people tirelessly, and worked on legislation and measures that benefited northern Colorado citizens and companies.&nbsp;Colorado GOP Chairwoman Kristi Burton Brown hailed him as someone who works to improve the lives of all Colorado families. In a tweet, she said,</p><p>“Every time I saw or talked to him, he had an encouraging word to say and was eager to raise people up.” Hugh McKean’s grin and a good view on life will come to me whenever I think about him.”</p><p>Hugh is survived by his girlfriend Amy, as well as his children Aiden and Hanna McKean.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifrp%2BYYrqkt8SapWaokajAprCMmq6asV2WwW7Ax55kmp%2BVYryneZRuZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bellator-mma.html><span>←</span><span>Bellator MMA - Showtime - Watch on Paramount Plus</span></a>
