Last week, the “Fancy” rapper revealed she doesn’t speak with Carti after he talked about her in a new interview with XXL on April 12. Following the interview, Iggy took to her social media and wrote a since-deleted tweet saying that the 25-year-old rapper’s interview with was “misleading,” especially the parts where he said kind things about her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>For the interview, which was done as a part of the hip hop magazine’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spring 2022 issue</a>, Carti gushed over Iggy and called her a “great mom,” adding how excited he was for his son’s birthday.&nbsp;“I love her to death. I’m single. She’s single now. But that’s one of the best mothers in the world,” he stated. “And that’s what you got to put in the book, you hear me? I love her to death. She is the best mother in the world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>What Carti had to say was ostensibly kind, but Iggy didn’t hold back in her tweet by noting how untruthful she believed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her ex</a> was being in the interview. Commenting on how the rapper spoke about paying bills for different people, including his “baby mom” and “son,” Iggy responded, <span>“I don’t f**k with a man I’m not even remotely on good terms with claiming he pays my bills,” she wrote. “I pay my bills,”&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Iggy also claimed that Carti doesn’t make such kind comments to her in person. “Saying nice things for an interview sounds great, but in real life he talks to me like s**t so badly I had to stop all direct contact,” she tweeted. “I do appreciate being called a great mom but when that’s not reflective of what he has to say in real life, I’d much rather be left out of being mentioned at all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FqZqKfl656osbApZyaZZ6axG6t0aZkrZmkqbywedKopWannq7FbsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gisele-bundchen-joaquim-valente-jiu-jitsu-video.html><span>←</span><span>Gisele Bundchen &amp;amp; Joaquim Valente Spar In Jiu-Jitsu Video Hollywood Life</span></a>
