After all, Epic Games has already brought titles such as God of War, Halo, and The Witcher to Fortnite — and there’s no denying FNAF likely shares much of the same audience as the battle royale.</p><p>But Five Nights at Freddy’s isn’t in Fortnite, and it’s unclear if a collaboration will ever take place.

Neither Epic Games nor Scott Cawthon have announced any plans to bring FNAF to the battle royale. However, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> asking players about characters they’d like to see in Fortnite was leaked earlier this year, and one of the names on the list was Monty from Five Nights at Freddy’s.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, this is far from a definitive confirmation that FNAF is coming to Fortnite, though anything can happen if Epic Games sees the demand is there. For now, however, it’s best to temper expectations and not get your hopes up. Surveys like this are incredibly common, and most names featured on the list never make it into the game.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These 'FNAF' Creative Maps in 'Fortnite' are a great substitute.</h2><p>While there’s no official way to enjoy the scares of FNAF in Fortnite, you can check out a bunch of unofficial, fan-made maps in Creative Mode. These often play out much like the original game, with players slinking around a dark map, avoiding jump scares, and unraveling a mysterious storyline.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Montgomery Gator has appeared in an Epic Games survey used to garner interest in characters and franchises coming to Fortnite! This is the first time FNAF has appeared on one of these surveys!

Keep in mind that some of these maps are no longer seeing updates, while others are starting to show their age. But if you’re looking to get a few scares in Fortnite, something in the above list is bound to get your heart racing.</p><p>Be sure to keep your eyes peeled, however, as Fortnite isn't shy about collaborations — and FNAF could be just around the corner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuss2anWahnmKzsL7Tp6CtnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dane-oneill-jockey-update-wolverhampton.html><span>←</span><span>Dane ONeill update after Wolverhampton race voided following jockey's sickening fall</span></a>
