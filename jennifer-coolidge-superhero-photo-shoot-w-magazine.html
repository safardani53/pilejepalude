The aesthetic and cinematographic style is behind the work of Godzilla, Mothra and Giant Robo and has inspired American shows like Power Rangers and now this iconic imagery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her photos, Coolidge dressed in a variety of costume-like pieces, including a lime green coat with sequin polka dots and a dress with a comedically oversized bow.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lenne Chai</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked why they chose to go for a Godzilla-like design for the shoot, Kwan opened up about the humanness of tokusatsu style and how it is more impressive to him than digitally rendered art.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He told the outlet, "Tokusatsu is so well done, but the special effects are always kind of handmade. If you look at the stuff from the '60s, you can feel the fingerprint. You can tell there's somebody inside the costume. There's something very charming about that, especially nowadays, when you can create anything digitally and nothing impresses you anymore."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>PEOPLE's free weekly newsletter</strong></a><strong> to get the biggest news of the week delivered to your inbox every Friday.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lenne Chai</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Coolidge arrived at the set and saw she would be electrocuting monsters, taking cities down and wielding larger-than-life swords, she was surprised to say the least. She opened up in the cover story about how much of a breath of fresh air the shoot was and how it was "one of the best things I have ever been involved in."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The film business tires people out," she shared. "But I swear to god, I felt like I was getting together with little kids. They were like these sort of child prodigies who are super, super smart and just super creative."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lenne Chai</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Opening up more about what the shoot means to her, Coolidge said, "I've never been asked to do a shoot like this: I have weapons, take down small cities, pick up cars and throw them. I don't know if I will ever be this surprised again. It was one of the best things I have ever been involved in."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The breath of fresh air and the surprise of it all were precisely what the directors were aiming for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There is so much pressure around Everything Everywhere All at Once, so our impulse for this shoot was to do the opposite," Scheinert said. "Not only do I really just want to dress up as a monster—I want to get our friends together, play with cardboard props, and go out to the desert."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqOcp6aZm7KzecKopqWhlJyybr%2FUqZyroJWnvG68x6irqGWjnbywwIywZKaZl5bHqrrEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simu-liu-rumored-girlfriend-jade-bender.html><span>←</span><span>Is Simu Liu Dating Rumored Girlfriend Jade Bender?</span></a>
