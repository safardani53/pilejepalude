The actor, 52, took to his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Stories</a> on August 9 to share footage of himself and his daughter<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Ava</strong></a>, 10, enjoying Lake Tahoe before the summer ends. In the first candid photo, Jeremy wore a mint green shirt with khaki pants and a white cowboy hat, as he stood in front of the gorgeous scenic view. Jeremy stood up on his own after <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>getting rid of the cane</a> that he needed to walk following the accident. “A beautiful day Bestows incredible Blessings together,” the Marvel star wrote alongside his photo.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>— via Instagram Stories. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/4zMDZombZc</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Jeremy Renner Net (@JRennerNet) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 10, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jeremy shared two more images of the beautiful view in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lake Tahoe</a>, one of which showed his daughter walking on rocks in the lake. Jeremy used a red-heart emoji to block Ava’s face in the photo. The 10-year-old had on a blue summer dress. Alongside the image of his daughter, Jeremy wrote, “Last Summer Adventure.” The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hawkeye</a> star shares Ava with his ex-wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sonni Pacheco</a></strong>, who he was married to from January 2014 until December of that year. Despite their <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>messy divorce</a>, Sonni was <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen at Jeremy’s Lake Tahoe home</a> in July.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jeremy-renner-healthy-photos-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jeremy has made amazing progress in his recovery since he broke more than 30 bones <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the New Year’s Day accident</a> that almost left him dead. A 14,000-pound snowplow ran over Jeremy in Nevada after he went in front of it to protect his nephew from being run over. After undergoing <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>several surgeries</a> and beginning physical therapy, Jeremy was on the road to recovery, and he opened up about the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>severity of the accident</a> to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News</a>&nbsp;anchor&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I was awake through every moment. It’s exactly what you would imagine it would feel like,” Jeremy said to Diane. “It felt like someone took the wind out of you. Too many things are going on in the body to feel pain, it’s everything.” The Mayor Of Kingstown&nbsp;star also revealed that he <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>considered end-of-life options</a> after suffering such horrific injuries. “Don’t let me live on tubes on a machine,” he recalled telling his family after the accident. “If my existence is going to be on drugs and painkillers, let me go now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jeremy was changed by the near-death experience.&nbsp;During an April appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he said he <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dropped twenty pounds</a> and gave up smoking. “Easiest way to quit smoking, I’m telling ya,” he said. “I couldn’t imagine not doing that and quitting smoking. I’d be a wreck of a human. But because I almost killed myself, I didn’t even think about smoking. It was easy peasy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BpZqOdopq6unnRnqWnnaJiw6KvwK2gqKZdoa6ssYytmKGnlWKup8DEq2Sspp%2Bsva271maYnJuZmbKvwIypn6isn6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./denee-benton-reprise-role-cinderella-broadway-revival-into-the-woods-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Dene Benton to Reprise Role of Cinderella in Broadway's Into the Woods</span></a>
