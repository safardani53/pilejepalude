In his remarks, the rabbi praised Bobby, calling him a “superb human being” and “a giant of a person … who touched thousands of lives.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And Jill — who spoke last — moved guests to tears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wasn’t sure if I could stand up here today,” the 54-year-old said. “[Bobby] was an incredibly great husband, a great father, and grandfather, and [a] truly great friend.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: RHONY Star Jill Zarin’s Husband Bobby Dies After Battle with Cancer</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jill — who teared up many times during the speech — also shared a touching story about how Bobby remained the generous and kind man she married right until the end.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said that in December, when Bobby was in the hospital for 22 days, her parents were celebrating their 60th anniversary. Although she wanted to go, she didn’t want to leave Bobby. But Bobby “insisted” that she go, and he was able to get out of the hospital “so I could go celebrate with my parents,” Jill said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jill Zarin/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that after his cancer took an unexpected turn last summer, she started knitting him a blanket — which was draped over his casket during the service.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When Bobby got sick in July, I needed something to keep my mind going,” she said. “[So] I started knitting him a blanket.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jill added that the blanket “kept growing and growing,” but that she was finally able to give it to him three days before he died. “He spent the last days of his life snuggled up in it,” she said, adding, “The irony is when I draped it over the casket, it fit perfectly. Bobby knew.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jill also gave a moving portrait of her final moments with her husband.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Friday, one day before Bobby’s death, the family knew things weren’t going well, so, Jill said, “We got the family together and we all slept with Bobby in the tiniest room at Memorial Sloan Kettering.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At one point, her husband’s eldest son David had to leave the hospital for a while, and Jill said she kept telling her husband not to go until David got back. And miraculously, shortly after David walked back into his father’s hospital room, Bobby took his last breath.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jill Zarin/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier in the service, Jill’s sister — judge Lisa Wexler — talked about the“fabulous love affair between Bobby and Jill” and how “Jill always said Bobby’s always right and that Bobby could never say no to her.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He was the ground to her air,” Wexler added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bobby’s children also got up to pay their respects, including his step-daughter Ally Shapiro.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Thank you for treating me as your own,” she said, adding, “he never said no to me, either.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He was the life of every party and the last man standing, and he derived great pleasure from helping others,” she continued.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the service, Morgan praised the “beautiful” memorial. “There wasn’t a dry eye in the room or a seat available,” she told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also shared how moving the speeches were — and that some of them even made people laugh. “Bobby would’ve loved every minute of it. … As the rabbi said he never had an ill word for anyone,” she added. “He was very special.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maples said she was “so blessed to have been embraced by the Zarin family.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had the great pleasure of making him the green potions I love to make,” she continued. “I will be there for Jill always.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Hublot of America</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the service, Frankel stood in the back, and afterwards she said a few words to Jill outside before she boarded a big black bus traveling to East Hampton for her husband’s burial.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gotham/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair had a very warm exchange as Frankel paid her respects to her former BFF’s late husband. Although the pair have barely spoken since since finding themselves on opposite sides of a bitter feud that played out on the third season of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>RHONY</a> in 2010, they have recently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>put aside their bad blood</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of Monday’s service, Zarin shared a tribute to her late husband on social media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rest In Peace my love</a>,” she captioned a slideshow of photos of the two over the years. (The coupled married in January 2001.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Words cannot express the hole in my heart. Bobby taught me what true and deep love is. Thank you my love for sharing your life with me… for raising Allyson as if she was your own, being an amazing father and grandfather and teaching me how to be a better person. You inspire those around you to be the best they can be. I will never forget you… your legacy lives on through your beautiful children and grandchildren,” she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bobby was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2009 and went on to have his thyroid removed. He also underwent radioactive iodine treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The radioactive iodine usually kills off whatever undetectable cancer cells are left in your body after surgery,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he previously told PEOPLE</a>. “We thought it was cured — and it usually is in about 93 percent of cases. But I wasn’t able to absorb the radioactive iodine. So it came back.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cancer wound up returning</a> and spread to his lungs. In 2016, Jill revealed to PEOPLE that he had been diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Gamma Knife Radiosurgery</a> at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. His cancer took an “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>unexpected turn</a>” last summer, and in July, he was admitted to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City while he recovered from a procedure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He is the most loving and caring person I have ever known besides my father,” Jill told PEOPLE at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Sometimes life just isn’t fair. But we have such a great love story. He is the love of my life, and I will do everything in my power to heal and care for him.”<i><br></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKu1y6Vks5minrtuuc6voKefXai9prHCoWShraOXrq%2BwjJumm5qpYrO2usSrmKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenn-melon-tiktok-star-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jenn Melon (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
