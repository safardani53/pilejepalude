She’s appeared in numerous campaigns for the French brand over the years as well. Being the muse for the fashion house runs in her blood, as mom Vanessa started her career with Chanel in October 1991, when she starred in a campaign for the Coco Chanel fragrance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lily-rose-depp-chanel-spl-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>However, Vanessa first burst onto the scene as a singer in her native France and throughout Europe at the age of 14, scoring a hit with the single “Joe le taxi.” She then went on to become one of the country’s most famous and beloved actresses, before becoming Chanel’s most sought-after model.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite being together for 14 years, beginning in 1998, Johnny and Vanessa never married.

The couple have since split and made headlines recently with their defamation court case, where Johnny was awarded $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages after he said Amber damaged his career when she wrote an article for&nbsp;The Washington Post claiming she was the victim of domestic abuse. Meanwhile, Vanessa married famous French director <strong>Samuel Benchetrit</strong>&nbsp;in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49uZqOnmKO7unnDnqepZZSWwqi0056pZqSZocZuvs6snGabmJa7priMrJ%2Bor12ltbDAzqxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-valentines-day-date-2023-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Lopez &amp;amp; Ben Affleck Have Valentines Day Date: Photo Hollywood Life</span></a>
