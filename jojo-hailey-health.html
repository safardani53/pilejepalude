And sometimes with age comes various health issues.</p><p>In February, news broke that Jojo might not be doing so well after footage from a recent concert went viral. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a> saw Jojo visibly disoriented before he was escorted off stage. Now, fans of the artist are wondering if he’s okay.</p><p>Both Sakoya and Tiny sat down for an interview with Distractify where they gave an exclusive update on Jojo’s health condition.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@sakoyawynter</a><p>Jojo Hailey, Sakoya Wynter</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘GUHH’s Sakoya Wynter gives an update on her dad Jojo Hailey’s health condition.</h2><p>In the past, Jojo has been candid about his struggle with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alcoholism</a>. However, it was only recently that we learned that he has been fighting a silent battle with diabetes for the last several months.</p><p>“He's diabetic, he was just recently diagnosed with diabetes within the past year,” Sakoya revealed. “And it's new for him.”</p><p>"A lot of us aren't as educated as others are when it comes to being diabetic and the steps you have to take to take care of yourself … to stick [yourself] with the needle and all these other things that come with it,” the Growing Up Hip Hop star went on. “He's still trying to figure those things out and just take good care of himself.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pray for Jojo from Jodeci he’s going through it!

In fact, they’ve been separated for more than a decade now.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“I just wanted to clarify because people are like, ‘Jojo had a stroke and Tiny left,’” she said. “No, Jo has never had a stroke. That's not what that was.</p><p>“I would never leave somebody because they're sick or turn my back," she continued. "Even in my relationship with Layzie … if Jojo is sick, I will go and see about him if need be.”</p><p>“It's never about money, or status, or any of that," she added. "I'm generally a caring human being. That's just what it is.”</p><p>You can catch Sakoya and Tiny on new episodes of Growing Up Hip-Hop Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on WE tv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yru4yhmKKkla56qbHApauh</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tony-rice-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tony Rice Dating Now</span></a>
