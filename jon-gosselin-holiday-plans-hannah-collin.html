Friends and family will come to the house and we’ll have ham and all that stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>“We cook together, but the kids don’t cook with us!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>NEW YEAR'S EVE</h2><p>As for <a href=#>New Year’s Eve</a>, Jon previously revealed to The U.S. Sun his <a href=#>upcoming gig</a> at <a href=#>Atlantic City’s Island Waterpark at Showboat</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Jon Gosselin">Read more on Jon Gosselin</h2><p>Jon said of the event: “It's a really high-end, nice place. It's a 70s-themed party and the music is 70s, 80s and 90s. The emcee is DJ Slice, who has toured with Ice Cube and Ja Rule. We're going to work well together.”</p><p>The gig will be a challenge Jon is ready to accept, as he plays mainly music from the 1980s to the 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon explained: “This will be my first event primarily in the 70s and early 80s, which I'm looking forward to. I have just been practicing the 70s. In my deejay community, we all share and try to help each other out. I always like a challenge.</p><p>"It's one thing to go to work and just play the music that you're accustomed to, and play to the audience, but to play to something you're not used to is way more challenging.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“You have to study the music. You have to hear it. You have to know what's gonna be next. And since I'm an open-format deejay, I don't prep songs. In quick mixing, you'll do like first verse, chorus, maybe instrumental out then the next song.</p><p>"You're going to want to play you know, classic songs from the 70s. So you're going to want to play almost the whole thing into the third verse.”</p><p>Guests could expect to hear <a href=#>Earth, Wind & Fire</a>, <a href=#>Gloria Gaynor</a>, The Trammps, <a href=#>BeeGees</a> and more ‘70s legends while partying in the indoor waterpark.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HOLIDAYS APART</h2><p>Jon won’t be spending the holidays with his other children, as he hasn't spoken to them in years.</p><p>But The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal Jon may soon be reconciling with his estranged kids now that they have all <a href=#>moved to their respective colleges</a>.</p><p>A source close to Jon told The U.S. Sun: “Jon sees them in the future communicating with him. It seems more real all the time. The chances are better now than they were before.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is alleviated pressure. Now that they're in their adulthood, they are expressing themselves as individuals more now than they could or would have been before.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FATHER'S HOPE</strong></h2><p>A source previously told The U.S. Sun in September that Jon <a href=#>never stopped trying to contact his children</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The insider claimed: "Jon has reached out to his kids on many holidays and birthdays, but while the kids are still living at home with Kate he has never heard back from them.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“He has high hopes that as soon as they are all out of the house and Kate can no longer push her agenda, he can begin to rebuild a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>“He realizes it will take time, but he will do everything to make up for lost years together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/eoy-christmas-apart-jon-gosselin-866532979.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/eoy-christmas-apart-jon-gosselin-866532980.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/3c5948d0-5e36-4c6c-88e1-441d2d2d65d6.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGyBd4SVaKGopl2cvLS%2FxKWgp2WYpLmqsMCyZKmkkaPAbrTAp6WaoF2YvK24yKdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-aniston-is-holiday-chic-in-black-jumpsuit.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Aniston Is Holiday Chic in Black Jumpsuit</span></a>
