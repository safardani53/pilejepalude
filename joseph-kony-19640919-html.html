While initially claiming to be resisting government oppression, the LRA is said to have turned to supporters of Kony, supposedly to "purify" the Acholi people and turn Uganda into a theocracy. Kony identifies himself as the spokesperson of God and a spiritual means and claims that he was visited by a group of 13 multinational souls, including a Chinese ghost. In terms of ideology, the group is a harmonious blend of mysticism, Acholi nationalism and Christian orthodoxy, and claims to establish a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and local Acholi tradition. Kony has been accused by government agencies of ordering the kidnapping of children to become child soldiers and sex slaves. 66,000 children became soldiers and 2 million people were displaced internally between 1986 and 2009 .</p><table class=wikibox readability=3><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Likely 1961 (age 59–60), Odek, Uganda Protectorate</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nationality</td><td class=wk_value>Ugandan</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Known for</td><td class=wk_value>Leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>42 (as of 2006)</td></tr></table><p>Criminal Joseph Kony was born in Uganda on September 19, 1964.
