She is a dancer, a pilates expert, a nutritionist, a business and life advisor, and an all-around spiritual entrepreneur.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In her words,&nbsp;</p><p>I help soul powered women entrepreneurs build impact driven online businesses without burnout.</p><p>Well, there is a certain overlap in their interests. However, it was a fairly unlikely relationship&nbsp;to begin with, because JP was based in the US while his wife was based in Costa Rica. But,&nbsp;nevertheless, they came together thanks to the wonders of the internet.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>JP Sears' Wife Looking Back On Their Relationship</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On January 29, 2019, Amber put up a post on her Instagram celebrating her husband and the relationship that they had built together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The post began with Amber recalling the early days of their relationship when they were just getting to know one another over Skype calls. She recollected,&nbsp;</p><p>I was so excited & nervous waiting for our calls. The butterflies were REAL & I was doing everything in my power to stay cool despite my giddiness.</p><p>In all honesty, she admitted how she was skeptical about the relationship and how it would function&nbsp;if the two ended up liking one another.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>At the time, she was living her dream life in a small beach town in Costa Rica. She lived with the jungle, leading shamanic retreats, drinking&nbsp;ayahuasca, and helping people heal. All the while, JP was out touring the US for his book, creating viral comedy videos, and doing what he loved based in Charleston, South Carolina.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>JP Sears and His&nbsp;Wife Overcame Challenges</h2><p>Admittedly, there were a few boundaries keeping them apart. Amber was worried he would find her alternative lifestyle a bit too much to handle. So, she did what she could do best. She took all her concerns to him, hoping to get rejected.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thankfully he said, 'Awesome! Tell me more. How can I support you?'" she wrote, "I was floored."&nbsp;</p><p>As to why she thought it all worked out for the best, she wrote, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>We were drawn together because we both mutually respect each other’s needs to be ourselves. Even if that means spending some time apart. Over the last two years we’ve figured out a way to weave our VERY different lives together.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple took their vows in front of their family and closest loved ones on March 20, 2017, in a breathtakingly beautiful outdoor wedding.</p><p>Earlier this week, on October 17, 2021, the couple celebrated their son Wilder's ten months of life. As the couple nears the five-year milestone of their marriage, they will also be celebrating their son's first birthday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKgYsCmrdGsZLChlpp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./feeling-faces.html><span>←</span><span>Feeling Faces - Nickelodeon - Watch on Paramount Plus</span></a>
