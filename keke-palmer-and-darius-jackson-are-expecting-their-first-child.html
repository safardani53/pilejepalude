Palmer, 29, confirmed her pregnancy on an episode of Saturday Night Live on December 3 by stating that she is definitely pregnant.</p><p>“There are some speculations going around, people have been saying in my comments, ‘Keke’s having a kid, Keke’s pregnant,’ and I want to clear the air – I am!”</p><p>On stage, she pulled up her long gray jacket to display her baby bulge. Although they started dating in the summer of 2021, Keke Palmer and Darius Jackson have been incredibly quiet about their relationship and reveal very little about each other on social media.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Oh my god! Keke Palmer just revealed she’s pregnant during her SNL monologue and showed off her baby bump! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2qsntIVmNF</a></p><p>— Spencer Althouse (@SpencerAlthouse) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">December 4, 2022</a></p><h2>Keke Palmer and Darius Jackson met at a party&nbsp;In 2021.</h2><p>According to Us Weekly, Keke Palmer and Darius Jackson first met in May 2021 at Sean “Diddy” Combs and Issa Rae’s Memorial Day Party. They kept their relationship a secret until August of that year when Jackson made it public on Instagram by uploading a photo with Palmer. He wrote in a now-deleted post:</p><p>“You’ve been a divine godsend. I never imagined summer 2021 would turn out the way it did, yet here we are. I’m pleased we were able to support each other through our darkest periods and demonstrate to one another that what we offer to the table is all we’ve got.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Keke-Palmer.jpg alt="Keke Palmer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Darius has over six years of experience in the entertainment and fitness industries. He works as a teacher at Inspire Fitness, according to his LinkedIn page. Sarunas Jackson, who appeared in Issa Rae’s sitcom Insecure, is also Jackson’s brother. Keke Palmer also appeared in the show.&nbsp;Keke Palmer told Harper’s Bazaar in March 2020 that she tries to keep her personal and professional life separate and that she does not date anyone from her own field.</p><p>“When it comes to dating, I’ve always had the same mindset. Not that I wouldn’t give it a go. I often wonder, “Does this individual truly like me for me?” It’s not only romantic connections either. It’s also pals. The most distressing aspect of stardom is the fluctuating.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Keke-Palmer-2.jpg alt="Keke Palmer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Keke Palmer and Darius Jackson don’t talk about each other on social media, but when asked about her new boyfriend on The Tamron Hall Show, she said it was “harder to conceal.” The Nope star went on to say that she would not conceal anything that makes her happy.&nbsp;Keke claimed on her recent SNL debut that she felt horrible that the internet rumors about her pregnancy were accurate since she had a lot going on and attempted to keep it “under wraps.”</p><p>“…However, this has been the greatest gift, and I am overjoyed. I’m going to be a mother, guys.”</p><p>Palmer was previously romantically connected to rapper Styn of the Mae Seven group before dating Darius. She has also had relationships with rapper Meek Mill and actor Quincy Brown.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiinqOVYr2iuMyeqWaZnpl6pa3RoqysZZqWsKy%2FzqdkmqqVYrK5vMScq6Kml2LBqbHIq2SfoaKowW6vx6KjnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-animated-shows-on-netflix.html><span>←</span><span>Here Are Some of the Best Animated Series on Netflix That Anyone Can Enjoy</span></a>
