Baumgartner said on the stand that she and Connor were purely platonic friends but did admit that he loaned her $20,000. According to Baumgartner, she sent half of the check to her mother and returned the rest to Connor.</p><p class=p1>Costner, 68, and Baumgartner <a href=#>split in May after nearly 19 years of marriage</a>, with the former jewelry designer filing for divorce. Baumgartner — who shares<a href=#> sons Cayden, 15, Logan, 14 and daughter Grace, 12,</a> with the <a href=#><i>Yellowstone</i></a> star&nbsp; — <a href=#>cited “irreconcilable differences” in her petition</a> and sought $248,000 in child support to <a href=#>keep their kids living the luxurious life</a> that they’ve been accustomed to. (A judge ruled in August that Costner <a href=#>will pay Baumgartner $63,209 per month</a> in support.)</p><p class=p1>Costner, for his part, has slammed Baumgartner’s claims, noting that he is unable to meet her demands because he does not have that type of money with <i>Yellowstone </i><a href=#>coming to an end after season 5</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-Costner-References-Christine-Baumgartner-Receiving-20K-From-Her-Boyfriend-in-Settlement-Docs-290.jpg><p class=p1>In his most recent filing, Costner has accused Baumgartner of failing to disclose her income and expenses to the court. (She has not addressed the claims.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Never mind that Christine has, at all relevant times, had $1.5 million at her disposal to use as she pleases, without prejudice to her <a href=#>challenge to the Premarital Agreement</a>,” the docs read. “All that matters to Christine is that the Court view Kevin as a ‘bad guy’ who wants to ‘ratchet up economic pressure’ and that the Court blindly adopt the image she tries to project as an impoverished victim.”</p><p class=p1>Despite <a href=#>he-said-she-said court filings</a> since May, Costner broke his silence on the proceedings earlier this month. “This is a horrible place to be, but this is where we’re at,” <a href=#>he told <i>Access Hollywood </i>on Friday, September 1</a>, after his testimony. “It feels so bad and we’re talking about somebody I love on the other side, I just can’t.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknaaeu26vzqyrp52iYrqmutOipqerXZrFbsPIn5xmm5intrTAyKecrGWSpManvsiepZ1lmaN6pbXVqKmcnV2ZvKS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./isabella-ronchetti-20011228-html.html><span>←</span><span>Isabella Ronchetti (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
