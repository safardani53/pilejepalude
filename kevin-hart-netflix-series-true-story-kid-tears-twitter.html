The funnyman, 42, has somewhat changed tack for gritty release True Story, which sees him play stand-up The Kid - who initially appears pretty similar to his off-screen persona.
Yet the plotline takes a dark turn and sees Kid battle to save his career alongside on-screen brother Carlton, played by Wesley Snipes.
The seven-episode mini series sparks some similarities with Kevin's life, with his character being Philadelphia-based, and in frequent conflict with his sibling."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
