It’s sickening."</p><p>Another pointed out that while Kim is being environmentally conscious by getting rid of her plastic bottles, she is still using tons of electricity to run four fridges.</p><p>They wrote sarcastically: "I got rid of all the plastic so I can run 4 refrigerators simultaneously that is barely efficient to showcase my clout chasing obnoxious 'I’m richer than you' aesthetic."</p><p>A third added: "There is literally no way they don’t waste a fuck ton of food."</p><p>Yet another user commented: "I mean I guess this is great if you wanna raise your kids up feeling like they live in a restaurant.</p><p>"This whole kitchen feels so impersonal and just dark and cold. there's really no need for all that even with 4 kids."</p><p>Kim lives in <a href=#>her Hidden Hills mansion</a> with her four children - North, nine, Saint, seven, Chicago, five, and Psalm, four.</p><h2>'DEPRESSING' HOME</h2><p>She has previously been slammed for <a href=#>creating a "depressing" environment</a> for her kids with her home decor.</p><p>Back in November, she shared snaps of a cream-colored coffee mug, an entirely beige sitting room, a plain marble chair, expensive artwork, and her minimal bedroom.</p><p>Critics claimed the house looked "gloomy and depressing" and compared her bare bedroom to a "tomb."</p><p>A month later, fans <a href=#>mocked an "ugly" detail about her living room</a> that made it resemble a "department store".</p><p>Kim had shared a video of a&nbsp;<a href=#>pianist playing Christmas tunes</a>&nbsp;in the morning at her mansion.</p><p>She documented her&nbsp;<a href=#>lavishly decorated Christmas tree</a>&nbsp;and her minimalist home as she captured the musician seated at her baby grand piano.</p><p>She captioned her post: "It's that time of the year...</p><p>"@philthekeys comes over every morning to wake my kids up by playing the piano while the mad morning rush is happening to calm their little souls and fill it with beautiful Christmas songs."</p><p>But the SKIMS mogul's fans were distracted by the huge gray couch in the center of the room.</p><p>The low-backed piece of modular furniture featured padded sides and extended out at various angles.</p><p>One critic wrote, "[The couch] is sorta fugly," and another agreed, adding: "It’s like they’re living in a department store."</p><p>Her sisters,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kourtney</a>, 43,&nbsp;<a href=#>Khloe</a>, 38, and her mother,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kris Jenner</a>, 67, have received similar&nbsp;<a href=#>criticism about their homes' decor</a>, or lack thereof.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/590f65bf-d1b6-41c0-bc50-73c596b95dd0.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/75f33fcd-0026-40db-8bb2-78b41b276761.jpg><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaGmDcYKXaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYr%2BqvM%2Bem2avkajBprLUpWSfp6Wneqe%2ByJ2enqtdoLa1r8eepWalkaPAqrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./middlesbrough-news-leo-percovich-car-crash.html><span>←</span><span>Ex-Premier League coach Leo Percovich injured in horror car crash which left his daughter dead and h</span></a>
