In June, she appeared in a swimsuit ad for Skims, rocking a faux leather bikini. In the campaign images, Kardashian ‚Äî <a href=#>who was all oiled up</a> ‚Äî lounged on green turf as models stood behind her.</p><p>The models, for their part, rocked bandeau bikinis, latex gloves, thigh-high boots, trendy headbands and black sunglasses.</p><p>In a different shot, Kardashian posed on top of a male model in a zip-up top and <a href=#>knee-high boots</a>. ‚ÄúSKIMS FAUX LEATHER & SCUBA SWIM COMING SOON,‚Äù she captioned the post tagging the photographer Steven Klein. (The faux leather swimsuit collection is now available at Skims.)</p><p>The shapewear brand explained in a press release that the faux leather line is the ‚Äúmost provocative swim campaign.‚Äù They elaborated, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern and sexy, providing an unconventional take on swimwear.‚Äù</p><p>Earlier this month, Skims debuted another <a href=#>sexy ad</a> starring <a href=#><strong>Jenny McCarthy</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Carmen Electra</strong></a>. For the photoshoot, the duo posed together and separately <a href=#>in designs from Kardashian‚Äôs label</a>. The models twinned in black bikinis while holding a hose to a bright red Ferrari.&nbsp;They turned up the heat even more by squeezing a sudsy sponge over their chests.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In other snapshots, the ladies could be seen holding electric guitars while giving the camera a pout. Elsewhere in the ad McCarthy, 50, made eating ice cream look sexy by licking her fingers with the dessert dripping down her chest.</p><p>Electra, 51, for her part, was photographed crawling on the floor in a short-sleeve gray top. Her blonde locks were tussled over her shoulder, and she finished the look with lined lips, <a href=#>long eyelashes</a> and cartilage earrings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6C2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK6jKyfmqqVqHq1tMRmrKWsmaKutbGMm6CkoZ6eerW0yKuqrWWkp66xew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-sara-decosta-hayes-dating.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Who is Sara Decosta-Hayes Dating Now</span></a>
