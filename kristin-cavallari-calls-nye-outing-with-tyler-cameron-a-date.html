“Who is the last person you went on a date with?” Stephen Colletti asked his 34-year-old “Back to the Beach” podcast cohost in a promotional video for their Dear Media show.
“It’s so funny to me how I get all of these questions every time and you get, like, the simplest stuff,” Cavallari responded."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The foursome was also joined by Bachelor Nation’s<a href=#><strong> Jason Tartick</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a>.</p><p>In a later-deleted video posted by Tartick in the early hours of January 1, the “Trading Secrets” podcast host questioned Cameron about why he was in Tennessee — and whether he was single. The former football player didn’t answer the questions and tried to flip the script on Tartick, who has been engaged to Bristowe since 2021.</p><p>Cavallari and Cameron were previously introduced in February 2022 during an appearance on E!’s Daily Pop. Two months later, the Bachelorette season 15 runner-up packed on the PDA with <a href=#>Cavallari in the Uncommon James designer’s campaign video.</a></p><p>“Tyler is the sweetest human being on the planet, such a great guy, I was so impressed with him,” she told Entertainment Tonight at the time. “There is nothing going on. Great guy, [but] we are not dating, I promise. If I was, I would not answer the question, put it that way. … Nothing is going on. He was a hired actor, OK?”</p><p>Later that month, Cavallari admitted that she hired Cameron “for press” — but called him a “very good kisser.”</p><p>“I mean, he is like such a love,” she said on “The Bellas Podcast,” adding: “I have nothing but good things to say about him. But we’re not dating. Everyone’s like, ‘Tell me everything.’ I’m like, ‘I think he’s great.’”</p><p>Cameron, for his part, told E! News that they had “so much fun” on the set.</p><p>“Kristin is just a joy and a pleasure to be around,” he noted at the time. “I love hanging out with her and getting to know her, so it was fantastic.”</p><p>Cavallari was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> from 2013 to 2020. They share three kids: sons Camden, 10, and Jaxon, 8, and daughter Saylor, 7.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=#>she made another comment to Colletti about her dating life.</a></p><p>“To be honest, I don’t want to say anything I’m going to end up regretting, but I don’t think I want to date another athlete,” she said on the Tuesday, January 17, episode of their podcast. “I’ve done that. I want to leave that in the past.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztYycmKWko2K7urGMqKytoZ6ceri106FkrbGcmr9ur8CmnKunnmKubrDArZxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessie-diggins.html><span>←</span><span>Jessie Diggins</span></a>
