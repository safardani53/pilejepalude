But as Lance and the rest of Bravo viewers saw this latest season play out, we all saw that Jax was reverting back to his old ways — especially when he <a href=#>repeated his biphobic comments</a> about a fellow cast member after already being told that what he said was very problematic.”</p><p>Taylor’s controversial moments on the Bravo show, however, weren’t the only red flags to Bass, who has since opened up about cutting ties with the TV personality in regard to their premium mixers company, <a href=#>Just Add X</a>.</p><p>“That, coupled with his past ignorant social media comments coming to light the past week, made it impossible for Lance to continue to have Jax on board — especially as a staunch advocate for equality,” the source adds.</p><p>The Michigan native <a href=#>came under fire earlier this month after his December 2017 tweet</a> alleging his <a href=#>former costar and fling <strong>Faith Stowers</strong></a> committed crimes resurfaced. He was then called out by <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a> star <a href=#><strong>Ashley Martson</strong></a> on June 9 for commenting on <a href=#>the size of her husband <strong>Jay Smith</strong>’s nose</a> in a social media comment from 2018.</p><p>Bass said during the Monday, June 15, episode of his “<a href=#>The Daily Popcast</a>” podcast that the reality star should be <a href=#>fired from the show following his remarks</a>, just as his Vanderpump Rules costars <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Max Boyens</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brett Caprioni</strong></a> were.</p><p>“He will lose out. I do not see Bravo keeping him,” the musician said. “I have a feeling soon this will be done.”</p><p>During the podcast, Bass also claimed that Taylor is “stepping down from [our] Just Add X [business venture].” He added, “<a href=#>We can’t be involved</a> and associated with any of this going down.”</p><p>Taylor’s rep, however, <a href=#>told Us in a statement on Tuesday, June 16</a>, that the Out of Sync author’s narrative wasn’t completely accurate. According to the Bravo personality’s rep, the Just Add X website was hacked last week and “hateful slurs” were showcased. After the incident, Taylor “felt horrible” and allegedly reached out to Bass and the team and offered to step down from the company.</p><p>“The team immediately followed up with a phone call with Lance and the team reassured and fully supported him,” the rep said in the statement. “It was decided that Jax would continue to stay on the team and that they all had his back given these unpredictable times.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The statement then addressed Bass’ podcast quotes, saying, “The statements from Lance on the podcast today are not only untrue but also extremely confusing and shocking, to say the least. Jax is still very much a partner and founder of Just Add X and supports the team and the brand whole-heartedly.”</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZ6Ysm6uwKyqZqGjYrGqv8Cpp6ihnqmypXnWoquhZZqWxW7AwLKjqKqjYr2iv9NmqZqbmajBbq%2FOpqSepqSofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./14-years-madisyn-shipman-is-dating-logan-patrick-know-about-her-affairs-and-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>14 Years Madisyn Shipman is Dating Logan Patrick, Know about her Affairs and Relationship</span></a>
