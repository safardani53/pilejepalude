Thanks to Anna’s fans for helping keep her memory alive. We love you Anna Nicole #annanicolesmith #loveisalive #ifmomcouldseeyounow.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Anna Nicole Smith was found dead in her Florida hotel room on Feb. 8, 2007, and her death was eventually ruled as an accidental drug overdose. Prior to her death at 39 years old, the former Playboy Playmate of the Year suffered a painful tragedy when her son, <strong>Daniel</strong> <strong>Smith</strong>, died in Sept. 2006 — only three days after she gave birth to Dannielynn in the Bahamas. His death was also ruled as an accidental drug overdose. He was only 20 years old at the time of his passing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/larry-birkhead-says-dannielynn-has-same-taste-as-anna-nicole-smith-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Anna Nicole Smith became a household name after she married 89-year-old oil tycoon <strong>J. Howard Marshall II </strong>in 1994. She then got into a nasty legal battle with his family over his $500 million fortune, following his death. And later in life, she made headlines due to a paternity battle over Dannielynn. Larry and Anna’s partner at the time, <strong>Howard K. Stern</strong>, as well as two other men, all claimed to be Dannielynn’s father, but in the end, a DNA test proved Larry was her father.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49xZqWZoqfGbq7Iq6KhnZGZeqK6zZpkp6GTpLmmedKmoK2gXZmyosDHZpinppmrsrO%2FwKuwZpulmbGttc2gZKmgn6m8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-red-dress-43rd-birthday-party-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Rocked Red Silky Dress for 43rd Birthday Party: Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
