Previously, she only uploaded shots of him on her Instagram Story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the pic, Larsa looked sporty chic in short cut-off jean shorts, a sheer black bodysuit and sneakers. She accessorized the look with shades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marcus wore red, white and black pants and a black shirt with a black backwards cap. Smiling for the camera, he also sported a beard and glasses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both were standing in front of a gigantic floral design of Marcus' dad's iconic No. 23 Bulls jersey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The design — made up of red and white flowers — is displayed behind a glass encasement at the Trophy Room store, which the Jordan family opened in Orlando, Florida. It's inspired by the famed trophy room in Michael's private residence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On his Instagram, Marcus lists himself as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>founder and CEO of the shop</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Marcus Jordan and Larsa Pippen.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Larsa Pippen Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Larsa, of course, has her own connection to basketball. She was previously married to NBA great Scottie Pippen <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>for more than 21 years before they split in 2018</a>. They share four kids together. Scotty Jr., 22, Preston, 20, Justin, 17, and Sophia, 14.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scottie, 57, famously played alongside Michael Jordan, 59, on the Bulls in the '90s, though had a notable falling out after the 2020 ESPN's docuseries The Last Dance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her Instagram post with Marcus, Larsa made it clear where her loyalties lie now. "Checks over stripes," she wrote — "checks" referencing Nike, a longtime partner of Michael Jordan's, while "stripes" calls out Adidas, Nike's competitor.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>VINCENT LAFORET/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">PEOPLE confirmed earlier this month that Larsa and Marcus were officially an item after months of speculation, a source saying they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"happy and dating."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A second insider elaborated more on the status of their relationship, telling PEOPLE: "It is still casual and they're having fun," they said. "She's trying her best to keep it quiet and not make a big deal out of it. They see each other at least a few times a week."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple was first spotted together at Zuma in Miami in September, though Larsa insisted to PEOPLE at BravoCon 2022 in October that the two were "just friends."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Charles Sykes/Bravo/Getty; Slaven Vlasic/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She played similarly coy about the romance when grilled about it during a December appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a>, where Marcus sat front-row in the audience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What does Scottie think about your friendship?" host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Andy Cohen</a>, 54, asked Larsa after she claimed Marcus was just a friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't know," she answered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A surprised Cohen followed up. "You don't know? He's never mentioned it to you, and you've never mentioned it to him?" he asked, Larsa responding, "No."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Housewives producer continued to press. "The kids have never said, 'This is bugging daddy?'" — to which Larsa said, "No."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cohen then asked the reality TV star if she understood why some people might think their friendship is "wild" considering Scottie and Michael's past. "I mean, I guess, yeah," Larsa said. "But I think a lot of people think that our families were really close and intertwined, and they really weren't. Like I never really knew Marcus' mom or them; I just recently met them a couple of years ago."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Larsa Pippen.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Vivien Killilea/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2022, Larsa opened up about her troubles dating after her divorce from NBA alum Scottie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like I am kind of mentally in a place of, like, I was married to a really famous guy that was really cute, that had a good body, that was really successful, that gave me four gorgeous kids," she said on an episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Melissa Gorga's</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Display</a> podcast.
