I certainly don’t know what half of them mean.</p><p>“Supersonic? I don’t know what that means. Champagne Supernova? I don’t know what a lot of that stuff means.</p><p>“I don’t even know what Bold means.”</p><p>Champagne Supernova includes the lyrics: “In a champagne supernova in the sky. Someday you will find me. Caught beneath the landslide. In a champagne supernova.”</p><p>While Supersonic has the following: “You need to be yourself. You can't be no-one else. I know a girl called Elsa. She's into Alka-Seltzer. She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000000400210.jpg><p>Liam isn’t too worried about the words being lost on him though, as he added: &nbsp;“I can sing anything and it’ll mean something because of the way I sing it.</p><p>“When I look at the lyrics I don’t go, ‘What’s this about?’ Not everything has to have a meaning. Life: what does that mean?”</p><p>Meanwhile the Wall Of Glass hitmaker has revealed he plans to release more music in the future as long as it’s something the fans want.</p><p>He said: "If this album had just dripped out there and no one paid much attention to it, I’d have been f***ed. Personally, I would have gone, 'I don’t think I’ve got the heart to go make another one.' But everyone seems to want another Liam Gallagher record, so who am I to deny them?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358944156.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003610289891-e1508973759655.jpg><p>"I hope they know I’m a real deal. The way I see it, it’s all about the universe, mate. I’ve been good to rock ‘n’ roll and rock ‘n’ roll has been good to me. Rock ‘n’ roll saved my life - it’s done it on many occasions. People have had it worse but the last four years I’ve sort of lost me way a little bit.</p><p>"Now it’s come around and been good again. Hopefully I’ll be good to it. The fans are cool, man. Being a Liam Gallagher fan must be f***ing hard work. But let me tell you, being Liam Gallagher is even harder because I’ve got to live with me 24/7."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Liam Gallagher announces he is headlining Finsbury Park 2018</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most Read In Showbiz and TV</h2></p><br><p><strong>Got a story?</strong> email <a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a> or call us direct on 02077824220.</p><p><strong>We pay for videos too</strong>.
