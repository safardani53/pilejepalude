It was such a great way to start the New Year.”</p><p>And on Valentine’s Day, Lisa, who famously dated George Clooney, posted a gushing tribute to the Yorkshire-born entrepreneur and wrote: “Happy Valentines to my love @i_smarticus Thank you for your patience, understanding, humour, the belly laughs, your insight, intelligence for believing in me and for loving me unconditionally and in turn enabling me to love myself and finally and best of all, for asking me to marry you. I love you.”</p><p><strong>Got a story? email&nbsp;<a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a>&nbsp;or call us direct on 02077824220</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqaG6Ad4CTaKOiq5FiwK%2B71p2mp2WSmq6zv4yapWatnpiur7rYZqmeq5Wir62tzZycZqyfYriiwMRmpKKclKGytbvNZpisZaOdsm6t0augr52jYq61ecuopZ2nnmKzor%2FHoqanZaeasqx7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fred-astaire-18990510-html.html><span>←</span><span>Fred Astaire (Movie Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
