Matt rocked a plaid button-up shirt and brown jacket while he smiled from ear to ear with his fiancée.

She was notably an employee at Roloff Farms prior to their courtship as well. “Our grand plan right now is to stay committed, stay in love, go to Arizona and spend a tremendous amount of time together,” she quipped during a confessional interview on the show in Aug. 2022. “Then when we’re here in Portland, we’ll live individually and see each other a lot.” And go to Arizona they did, as Matt shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a selfie</a> from the plane with her on Apr. 2. “taking a short (4 day) break from the projects back in Oregon to grab a few days of sunshine down in AZ,” he captioned the sweet post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The TV personality was previously married to&nbsp;<strong>Amy Roloff</strong>, 60, from 1987 until they divorced in 2016. Most recently, Amy found love once more and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married&nbsp;</a><strong>Chris Marek&nbsp;</strong>in 2021. Although Amy and her ex might’ve called it quits on their marriage, they maintain a “cordial friendship” with each other, according to the same outlet. The two couples even spent a day together in Oct. 2022 to ring in pumpkin season at the farm.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“First weekend of 2022 Pumpkin Season in the books..
