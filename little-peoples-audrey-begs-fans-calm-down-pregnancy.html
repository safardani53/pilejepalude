From where?" she replied: "Thanks for reminding me!" with a winky face.</p><p>"I put them in my pocket so I wouldn't forget after I ate. I take different things depending on the day and how I'm feeling or what's going on that week (if we're traveling, need extra immune support, on my period, tired, etc.)</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Audrey Roloff">Read more on Audrey Roloff</h2><p>"But my dailies in pill form (I take other powders and liquids) include Beef Liver, electrolyte minerals, vitamin c, and just started taking Inspiracell and Prenatal."</p><p>Fans were shocked to hear that Audrey had begun taking Prenatal vitamins, apparently flooding her DMs with questions about a fourth pregnancy.</p><p>But just a little while later, the TV personality returned to her stories with a concerned selfie, captioned: "Woahhh y'all can calm down I'm not pregnant, just taking a prenatal to prepare my body in advance.</p><p>"I've never been consistent taking it before getting pregnant so trying to get ahead of it this time!</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"And my midwife recommended the Thorne one so I'm trying that!" she explained.</p><h2>PREGNANCY CLUES?</h2><p>Earlier this month, rumors spread that Audrey is pregnant with her fourth child after she <a href=#>dropped two major hints on her social media.</a></p><p>The mother of three took to her Stories on March 17 to finally answer a follower Q&A she had previously hosted.</p><p>After one fan asked: "Why did you make the switch to decaf? Notice any changes??" the TV personality explained how she's cut both caffeinated coffee and alcohol out of her life.</p><p>"I've been doing it since Lent started. I have been wanting to try going off for a while to see how I feel.</p><p>"I've been drinking coffee since college and also drank it through all my pregnancies and postpartum (with the exception of the first few weeks of pregnancy when it sounded repulsive to me) so far I've noticed my heart being less pounding feeling and I also feel less panicky and 'hurried' in the mornings."</p><p>Audrey continued: "And my Oura ring says my sleep has been better too but that could be some other things too.</p><p>"I also haven't drank alcohol in a couple of months and I've been running a lot more the last couple months too," she admitted.</p><h2>FAN SPECULATION</h2><p>Fans took to Reddit to discuss how the lifestyle changes could signal a potential fourth pregnancy for the TLC star.</p><p>"There will be a pregnancy announcement soon… I think she has been hinting around for a while," one wrote.</p><p>Others noted how she mentioned she "loves birth" during the Q&A, further fueling the speculation.</p><p>"'I love birth' what," one joked.</p><p>"Right? Such a weird statement. She could love being a mother but loving birth is beyond strange," a second agreed.</p><p>"She loves 'birth?!'" a fourth trolled.</p><p>"Also, she loves BIRTH? Idk that made me chuckle. Like giving birth to my daughter was joyful but I wouldn’t just say Oh I love birth, I wish I was in labor 24/7!" a fifth admitted.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Who the f**k says they love 'birth'?!?!" a final scoffed.</p><p>Audrey already shares three kids, Ember, five, <a href=#>Bode</a>, three, and Radley, one, with her husband <a href=#>Jeremy</a>, 32.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/little-people-critics-rip-audrey-787080594.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/www-instagram-com-p-cm8ilqamc9x-793252908-5.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ2mEdn2SaKOirKShsm68xKinpZ2jYq62sNGesGaalZzAbrLAp6pmm5Ghum6wzrClZqiimrSvrc2csGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenya-moore-daughter-brooklyn-oversized-sunglasses-pic.html><span>←</span><span>Kenya Moore Captures Daughter Brooklyn In Oversized Sunglasses: Pic Hollywood Life</span></a>
