Pizzagate believers think they're covered in sex trafficking symbols.</h2><p>If you aren't familiar with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pizzagate</a>, it's a right-wing conspiracy theory that's somewhat adjacent to <a href=#>Qanon</a>, which believes that the Democratic Party is essentially involved in a massive, satanic child sex-trafficking ring, according to Esquire. Some who believe in the theory have taken to TikTok to show "sex-trafficking symbols" they've found on their children's L.O.L Dolls, which they say is a plot to desensitize kids to sex at a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@authorians</a> recorded a video of himself describing an L.O.L Dolls commercial his daughter was watching, saying the ad was embedded with Pizzagate content. He noticed one of the girl dolls was dressed in sexual clothing, also resembling a young boy who was roped into a sex trafficking ring several years ago. In a follow-up video, he noted checkered patterns, which is common in satanism.</p><p>"These are the role models for our kids... keep that in mind," he says.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Similarly, TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@sueanngentry</a> recorded herself submerging a doll in water, and pulling it out to see her wearing lingerie.&nbsp;</p><p>"You guys see this? This is not fake," she says.</p><p>Her next video showed her submerging the doll, finding it decked out in wings and a devil tail.
