You can get that just from buying one.”</p><p>There are also certain games that offer better chances of winning, according to lottery expert and accountant Jared James.</p><p>“It’s not just completely random,” James said. “Our motto is luck favors the prepared.”</p><p>The games with the best chances of winning the most money possible tend to be the older games with not as many tickets left.</p><p>With older games, fewer Americans will play, but many still have a big top prize still waiting to be won.</p><p>“Finding those games where there’s that big, overlooked prize” was one strategy that earned one <a href=#>North Carolina</a> man a whopping $5million, James said.</p><p>Remember, playing the lottery always requires an inherent level of risk, and you should only play if you can afford to do so.</p><p>Those who may be struggling with gambling can reach out to the National Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-522-4700.</p><h2>WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU WIN?</h2><p>You might think it’s the end of all your problems once you win big in the lottery.</p><p>However, it’s important you make the right decision when it comes to whether you want the yearly annuity payments or the lump sum cash.</p><p>The choice you should make will depend on several factors, Jared James said.</p><p>“To me, it’s a person-by-person case,” James said.</p><p>For some people, having the lump sum just “isn’t a good idea,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>You might need a little protection from yourself, the mathematician said.</p><p>“They have to look at their situation and consider taking the annuity,” James said.</p><p>With such a huge increase in wealth, you’ll also want to hire a financial advisor, who can help you divert the funds into proper investments.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>One lottery winner</a> was forced to give her money back based on official rules and is warning others.</p><p>Meanwhile, a group of lottery pool winners faced a lawsuit after winning a whopping <a href=#>$315million jackpot.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbYJ1fZZrbWikn6nBpr7YZq6ipp6av265wKuwpZmemXq0wNGaq56fqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./behold-heidi-montag-bikini-photos-shocking-we-know.html><span>←</span><span>Heidi Montag Bikini Photos.
