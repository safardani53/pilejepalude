In the lawsuit, she accused him of doing this to ruin her career, possibly out of a desire for revenge.</p><p>Vanessa also alleged that Luis tried to interfere with her friendships, isolating her from once-close social bonds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Memorably, she described Luis as extremely sexually demanding, insisting that she be "available for sex" — like the wife in a cult — on demand.</p><p>If she was not, she described, he would "punish" her, being unkind, withdrawn, and blaming her.</p><p>As a positive outcome of this, she has gone on to become a licensed therapist who specializes in narcissistic abuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Another ex, Paula Sanchez, described similar incidents of harsh demands for sex, interlaced with lovebombing episodes.</p><p>While that is less serious than when coupled with career sabotage, manipulative behaviors on that scale can make people</p><p>According to her, things were fine and well … until he left her, seemingly without warning, in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Now, Margaret Jacobs did bring up an accusation on the show — a claim that Luis had physically abused a woman.</p><p>If it’s possible for any incident of domestic violence to be "worse" than another, this allegedly went down in front of the woman’s children.</p><p>Luis was even confronted about this on the show, but insisted that he had a "couple of very angry exes" who were "thirsty for attention."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After something as harrowing as that, it almost feels petty to discuss the "Warrior Camp" video, but it’s worth noting.</p><p>The bizarre retreat, and a video from it, became a hot topic on the show, as Luis appeared shirtless on a beach. It was just … weird.</p><p>While "warrior" is kind of an odd name for anything that’s not a video game, sports team, or a book about cats, that one seems more innocuous than the others.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WCcLjUoqpmqqWauaK%2FjJqjpWWfm3q1tMRmqpyZoq56s7HDZp2lmZeoerW0wK1krZ2imsCiecOonKympGLEorrTZqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./woody-harrelson-joins-snl-five-timers-club-scarlett-johansson.html><span>←</span><span>Woody Harrelson Joins SNL Five-Timers Club with Help from Scarlett Johansson</span></a>
