Like, she talked to us afterward. She felt unsafe. She was so distraught but really holding it together,” Bookout recalled.</p><p>“I think for me I just took away like big time just, it’s not her responsibility all the time to just sit and deal with it and carry it the whole time.”</p><p>Maci went on to reveal that the incident impacted her deeply, as it led her to reflect upon her own unconscious prejudices.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-pic.jpg><p>“It’s just retraining my brain to not just be a privileged white person that doesn’t have to deal with it,” she told Raj.</p><p>Maci said that she realized she hasn’t done enough to address the problem of racism in America.</p><p>She told her friend that after learning what Cheyenne is forced to endure on a regular basis, she’s resolved to take a more active approach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/maci-bookout-opens-up-1024x613.png><p>Bookout said that she plans to speak more candidly with her children about the realities of racism and white privilege.</p><p>“I do notice things that I need to be better. I mean we have conversations with our kids but not the younger ones,” she said.</p><p>“I’m just trying to think of age-appropriate ways to keep the conversation open.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021.jpg><p>“I feel like every room I walk in I’m the only black girl and everyone turns and looks at me,” Floyd said during the trip.</p><p>Later in the episode, she observed that her co-stars sometimes seem blind to the prejudice that surrounds them.</p><p>“Why is it that I’m the only f–king person who sees all the f–king confederate flags? Why am I sitting there? You saw it. I saw it. So what the f–k?” she said at one point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After leaving the rodeo, Cheyenne seemed upset that her co-stars were oblivious to her suffering.</p><p>“I don’t think I want to go back in there,” she said while sitting outside the venue</p><p>“I thought it was because of gunshots,” Maci said of Cheyenne’s absence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Floyd was recently shot at, and it seems that Maci thought her distress was a result of trauma from that incident.</p><p>To her credit, when Maci realized what had happened, she was apologetic, and she took steps to address the issue of bigotry in her own backyard.</p><p>Maci might have acted late, but that’s better than not acting at all, and fans were quick to praise her for her corrective actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I love how Maci & Taylor has these conversations with their children, it’s beautiful and more white counterparts need to do the same…” one viewer tweeted, <a href=#>according to </a>UK tabloid The Sun.</p><p>“I appreciate Macy attempt to teach her children about race, racism and humanity. Many people aren’t doing that.”</p><p>Interestingly, Florida resident Briana DeJesus, who helped to plan the trip, revealed that she’s never encountered such prejudice in her own life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Me personally, I am Hispanic and I’ve never been in a situation where I felt like racism affected me so I feel like it’s not my place to say anything.</p><p>“I do have an African American daughter, Nova, and you know Stella also and we’ve never experienced it yet and I don’t know how to handle it or approach it when that time comes.”</p><p>Clearly, the cast of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter learned a lot this week — and hopefully, the same can be said of the show’s viewers, as well.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2BcLnAnKKepqqesm65wqScnmWimq6kwNJmq6hlopawqr%2FTZpmupJyutq%2BzjKidZpuYmsamus2eZJ%2Bkn66xbsPHoqueZaCavLG4xGajoqOVYrqmec2enJ1lpKR6pbuMm5ytrJWnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./milo-ventimiglia-had-serious-crush-on-hayden-panettiere.html><span>←</span><span>Milo Ventimiglia Had Serious Crush on Hayden Panettiere</span></a>
