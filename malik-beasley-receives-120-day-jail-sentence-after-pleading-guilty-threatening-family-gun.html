After two years of probation, he is able to petition for the reduction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Under probation, the NBA star is not allowed to use alcohol or drugs, will be subject to random drug testing and must complete an anger management program. He also has a lifetime ban from gun possession.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Beasley's remote sentencing, a victim statement was read from the family citing "severe emotional trauma."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am not that person. I humbly apologize for my actions," the NBA player said in response.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His attorney, Steven Haney, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ESPN</a>, "We are very pleased with this outcome that will allow Malik to continue working on becoming a better person and making better choices."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Reaves/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September, Beasley pointed an assault rifle at a couple and their 13-year-old who were on a Parade of Homes after they had stopped outside of a Plymouth, Minnesota, residence rented by the NBA star and his now-estranged wife, Montana Yao.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In response to Beasley's sentencing, an attorney for Yao, Paul Applebaum, tells PEOPLE in a statement on behalf of his client, "Mr. Beasley brought the 120 day jail-sentence upon himself. The court quite properly held him accountable for a crime that was the culmination of a string of troubling behaviors on his part. As the cellphone video of the incident makes clear, his conduct on the day of his arrest was unimaginably dangerous."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"First, he brandished a rifle at a vehicle full of innocent civilians and; after that, put his toddler son and wife in serious danger when the police were dispatched to the house. The amount of jail time that the court imposed underscores the seriousness of the crime that he committed," Applebaum adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prosecutors said the family, who assumed the house was closed after seeing that it was roped off, were in the process of finding another home to view when Beasley pointed his firearm at them and told them to leave the property.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Officers later obtained a search warrant to locate the rifle and allegedly found more than 835 grams of marijuana in the home as well as three firearms, according to a criminal complaint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Beasley's hearing in December, he entered a plea deal and prosecutors dropped a felony fifth-degree drug possession charge related to the case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amid Beasley's legal drama, his romance with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Larsa Pippen</a> continues to blossom.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Larsa Pippen; Malik Beasley.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Vivien Killilea/Getty Images; David Sherman/NBAE via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair was first linked in November when they were photographed holding hands while shopping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the images were published, Beasley's wife said she had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>no idea</a> her husband was out with Pippen. "Wow… I don't even know this man…" Yao, who shares a child with the athlete, wrote on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram Stories</a> at the time. "This is wild y'all I'm seeing it for the first time just like y'all."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yao later filed for divorce and claimed that she and her 22-month-old son Malaki Joesph "were told to leave our family home 10 days ago" due to the scandal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Larsa Pippen Receives Flirty Instagram Comment from Married Malik Beasley amid Drama with His Wife</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pippen <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>claimed Beasley and his wife were separated</a> when they started dating, although Yao said that is "100% false."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0mikmqSZoHqjscCso56xXaeypLHIr5ysZWFnfW6wwLJko5mZoXq0sc2tnKeblWKup8DEq2SppJWWsaq6xmaerqGcqcZuwMernJqslaO2r7OMn5imoZyueqjBzWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jp-sears-wife-html.html><span>←</span><span>JP Sears Is Ready to Celebrate Sons First Birthday with Wife Amber</span></a>
