Over the course of the last couple of years, the brunette beauty has blossomed into a bonafide style star with her cool-yet-polished take on trends (we even named her one of our Breakout Style Stars of 2018)."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The This Is Us star turns 36 today, April 10, and we’re celebrating paying homage to her best dressed list-worthy style. The singer and actress has been a red carpet staple since her early pop star days, and her fashion sense has subsequently matured right along with her career.</p><p>Over the course of the last couple of years, the brunette beauty has blossomed into a bonafide style star with her cool-yet-polished take on trends (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we even named her one of our Breakout Style Stars of 2018</a>). Since landing the role of Rebecca Pearson on the NBC hit drama This Is Up, she has slayed everything from awards season to Fashion Week in gorgeous gowns and chic separates that play with color, texture and proportion but never take themselves too seriously.</p><p>Working with stylist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristina Ehrlich</a>, the Garnier ambassador has cultivated a vibe the pro described to InStyle as “sophisticated Californian.” That translates to plenty of high-fashion ensembles from brands like Dior, Schiaparelli, Ralph Lauren, Stella McCartney and Missoni that still manage to stay true to her low-key glam roots.</p><p>Case in point? The dreamy Rodarte gown she wore to wed <strong>Taylor Goldsmith</strong> in November 2018. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blush-pink tiered design</a> was equal parts feminine, fashionable and fun — just like the star herself.</p><p>“She loves to wear dresses, but ones she can throw on with her favorite pair of slides and dress up with a bag from Loewe or Saint Laurent,” Ehrlich <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told InStyle</a>. “Mandy knows what she likes and what looks best. Our collaboration exists in that she really allows us to present new ideas and new designers she may have never worn before.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In honor of Moore’s 36th birthday, we’re taking a look back at her recent style evolution.
