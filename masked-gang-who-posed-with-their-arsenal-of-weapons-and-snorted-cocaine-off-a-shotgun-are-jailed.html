He had previously pleading guilty.</p><p>The 22-year-old was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court along with Malcolm Graham, 19, of Albert Road, Southport, Merseyside.</p><p>Graham was filmed firing the pistol that later killed 17-year-old Kelvin Wilson after he was shot in the head in February this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256226888.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256226952.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256238962.jpg><p>Mercer was handed a three-year sentence and Graham was locked up for 11 years while a third offender, Lewis Clarke, 18, of Southport Road, Formby, Merseyside, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years for firearm offences on Tuesday.</p><p>No one has ever been convicted of killing Mr Wilson near Smithdown Road in Liverpool last year.</p><p>Graham had earlier admitted charges of possessing a prohibited firearm, possession of a firearm without a firearms certificate and two counts of Section 20 wounding.</p><p>The first attack was on a prison inmate while the second attack was on Mercer after a disagreement.</p><p>Clarke had also pleading guilty to possessing the Baikal self-loading pistol, possession of ammunition without a firearms certificate and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>He also admitted possession of ammunition with intent to cause fear of violence after he fired a blank firing pistol which contained a homemade bullet during a dispute at a friend's house in Gardner Road, Formby on May 14 last year.</p><p>Following the sentencing, Merseyside Police Detective Inspector Richie Jones, said: "The sentencing of these three offenders today sends out a strong message to those who are involved in gun crime - Merseyside Police is committed to taking those involved in gun crime off the streets.</p><p>"Malcolm Graham and Lewis Clark were both linked by DNA, photographs and video to a weapon which just three weeks before it came in to their possession was used to murder Kevin Wilson on Smithdown Road in February 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256227022.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256226955.jpg><p>"These three thought that they were untouchable and were seen in photographs on phones owned by Graham and Clarke with the weapons. Mercer was also videoed on the phone snorting cocaine off a sawn-off shotgun.</p><p>"People like Malcolm Graham, and those he associates with, have a complete disregard for each other, as you can see from the assault on Mercer, let alone other members of the public.</p><p>"They use fear, violence and intimidation to get what they want and think they can do what they want without any come back. They couldn't be more wrong."</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
