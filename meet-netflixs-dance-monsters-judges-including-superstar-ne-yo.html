With the help of advanced CGI technology, they‚Äôll bust their moves off-camera while their monsters boogie down for the world.‚Äù</p><p>The 15 competitors behind the CGI monsters have all been through struggles that have held them back from dancing professionally.</p><p>Viewers will not be able to physically see the contestants behind the CGI monsters, until they are voted out the competition. They will however get to know their stories and struggles throughout the episodes.</p><p>At the end of the series, the panel of judges will give one contestant the title of Ultimate Dance Monster and a $250,000 prize.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-the-dance-monsters-judges>Meet the Dance Monsters judges</h2><p>The judges of the show are no short of dancing experience themselves. Introducing Ne-Yo, Ashley Banjo and Lele Pons.</p><p>Ne-Yo is an American singer, songwriter, and producer who is known for his hit songs such as Let Me Love You. The singer came second in The Masked Singer UK, disguising himself as Badger, so this concept won‚Äôt be too unusual for him.</p><p>Ashley Banjo is no stranger to reality shows or dancefloors himself, famously winning Britain‚Äôs Got Talent with his group Diversity in 2009. This isn‚Äôt his first time on a judging panel, having judged on the shows Got To Dance and Dancing On Ice.</p><p>Last but not least, is Lele Pons. Lele was one of the most followed creators on Vine before TikTok was a thing. Of course, she‚Äôs now moved over to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> and boasts over 28 million followers on the app. Lele is the queen of TikTok dances, so this role is right up her street.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fans-are-loving-the-new-netflix-show>Fans are loving the new Netflix show</h2><p>So far, Netflix has only dropped the first 3 episodes of the show, but fans are already loving it.
