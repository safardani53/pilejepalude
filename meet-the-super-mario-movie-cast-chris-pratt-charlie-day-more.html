That’s right, the <a href=#>world’s most famous plumber</a> is returning to the silver screen for the first time since the 1993 live-action movie Super Mario Bros.</p><p>“I worked really closely with the directors, and [after] trying out a few things … landed on something that I’m really proud of and can’t wait for people to see and hear,” the film’s star <a href=#><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a> told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in June 2022.</p><p>He continued, “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a <a href=#>live-action movie</a>. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”</p><p>The iconic figure created by <strong>Shigeru Myamoto</strong> made his debut in the 1981 video game Donkey Kong. Since then, Mario has appeared in over 200 games. In a September 2021 Instagram video, Pratt joked about how a <a href=#>story from his childhood</a> foreshadowed him stepping into the Nintendo character’s brown shoes.</p><p>“There was this coin-operated laundromat near my house, and it had Super Mario Brothers, the original arcade game. Oh, I loved that game. I never had a quarter, it felt like,” the <a href=#>Parks and Recreation alum</a> said, revealing that he would steal change from a nearby wishing well to play.</p><p>He continued, “That’s wild. It just dawned on me right now. The quarter I stole out of the wishing well to play Super Mario Bros. has come true that I get to be the voice of Mario. Clearly, I stole someone else’s wish, so I’m just waiting for that row of karma dominoes to come crashing down.”</p><p><strong>Charles Martinet</strong>, who has been the voice actor for Mario and Luigi in the Nintendo games since 1992, is slated to make several <a href=#>cameos in the film</a>. In addition to portraying the heroes of the franchise, he has also lent his voice to their villainous counterparts, Wario and Waluigi, in various video games.</p><p>In a January 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Retro Gamer</a>, Martinet expressed his gratitude to have been the voice of the beloved characters for so long.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have been given so many beautiful gifts,” he told the outlet. “Of course, I want to play ALL the parts, all the time. But, you know, I can’t imagine a more fulfilling, joyful, fun time and fun career than the one I am having.”</p><p>The video game-inspired film is set to hit theaters in April 2023.
