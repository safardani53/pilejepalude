<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Meghan Markle Wrote a Sweet Valentine's Day Post in 2015</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>What a difference three years can make! Prior to meeting and getting engaged to <strong><a href=#>Prince Harry</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> </strong>shared a Valentine’s Day post on her former lifestyle blog, <a href=#>The Tig</a>, to remind readers about the importance of self-love.</p><p>Markle, 36, wrote the candid post in 2015 about being down in the dumps during the holiday. She revealed that her then-Suits costars <strong>Sarah Rafferty</strong> and <strong>Gina Torres</strong> pulled her out of it by reminding her to be kinder to herself.</p><p>“Last season I was chatting with my Suits sister wives, Sarah and Gina, and was in some sort of funk, bemoaning something that was so futile I don’t even remember what it was now,” she <a href=#>wrote</a> at the time. “But I was faaaaaar from showing [myself] self-love.”</p><p>The actress continued: “One of them stopped me — truth be told I can’t remember which one because they both impart their sage wisdom with me on the daily — but one of the stylish wise ones stopped me and said, ‘Hey! That’s my friend you’re talking about. Be nice to her.’”</p><p>“They were protecting me from myself. From my own criticism, and my own self-doubt. They were reminding me to treat myself as well as I treat those closest to me,” she wrote. “To be my own valentine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/prince-harry-meghan.jpg><p>The actress revealed that being single at the time was not going to stop her from celebrating. “This Valentine’s Day I will be with friends, running amock through the streets of New York, likely imbibing some cocktail that’s oddly pink, and jumping over icy mounds in my new shoes through the salted snowy streets of the West Village,” she shared. “But those shoes, by the way, were my <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> to myself. Because I’ve worked hard, because I’m not going to wait for someone to buy me the things I covet (nor do I want to), and because I want to treat myself as well as I treat those dearest to me. Because I am my own funny Valentine.”</p><p>Markle reminded her readers that the day is not just for spending with a significant other, but a day to celebrate love in all its forms: “So whether you have a special someone, you’ll be with friends, or you’ll be flying solo this Valentine’s Day (or any other day for that matter), be good to yourself.”</p><p>She added: “Love yourself, treat yourself, honor yourself and celebrate you. Be your own beautiful, darling, cherished and funny Valentine. You deserve it.”</p><p>Markle has found her prince charming since. The British royal, 33, and the Suits alum <a href=#>announced their engagement</a> in November and are set to marry at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in England on May 19. The pair <a href=#>arrived in Scotland</a> on Tuesday, February 13, ahead of their second Valentine’s Day together to attend Scotland’s Year of Young People 2018 event.</p><p>After Markle began dating the royal in 2016, the actress&nbsp;<a href=#>shut down her website</a> in April 2017. She had initially launched it in 2014 and shared stories about her life and charitable work, and also wrote about food and travel.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The website now features a letter from Markle thanking her readers. “After close to three beautiful years on this adventure with you, it’s time to say goodbye to The Tig. What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity,” she wrote at the time. “You’ve made my days brighter and filled this experience with so much joy.”</p><p>She concluded the letter with a positive message: “Above all, don’t ever forget your worth – as I’ve told you time and time again: you, my sweet friend, you are enough.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZedrq95zJqppKSVYsSzu9OeZJplo6yypsCMr5ilnZ6ptq%2Bx0mabmrFdpby0wIyipWZqYGaCcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keke-palmer-and-darius-jackson-are-expecting-their-first-child.html><span>←</span><span>Keke Palmer And Darius Jackson Are Expecting Their First Child</span></a>
