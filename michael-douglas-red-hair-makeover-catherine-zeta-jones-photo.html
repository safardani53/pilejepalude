The actor, 78, was spotted with his new hair makeover as he left a restaurant, where he got lunch with his wife <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>&nbsp;</strong>in Paris on Tuesday, November 1. Michael’s hair was much longer than it had been, and it appeared that he dyed it a light shade of red (maybe for a new film project). He’d first debuted the look a few days earlier in a video on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/michael-douglas-hair-makeover-2022-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Besides the new hair, Michael sported a gray sweater over a white-collared shirt. He rocked a pair of off-white slacks, and some black comfy-looking shoes. The&nbsp;Ant-Man&nbsp;actor also had a pair of sunglasses pulled up on his head. It’s not clear if the new hairstyle was for a new movie or TV show that he’s working on. The actor is expected to appear in the upcoming&nbsp;Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania,&nbsp;which is in post-production, and a new film with Apple, where he’ll play <strong>Ben Franklin,&nbsp;</strong>according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Catherine, 53, was very low-key in her outfit. She sported a black blazer and a matching cap, as well as sunglasses, as she dipped out of the restaurant. While her outfit was mostly black, she did accessorize with a bright pink scarf around her neck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/michael-douglas-hair-makeover-2022-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Michael’s red hair was first shown in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> that seemed to be taken on a Paris rooftop, where he wished his followers to have a great weekend. The long hair was seen poking out under a baseball cap, as he wore a pair of shades. “Have a good one! Lots of love!” he said in the video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/michael-douglas-hair-makeover-2022-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Besides their lunch date in Paris, Michael and Catherine <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>enjoyed a trip</a> to Italy back in September to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrate their birthdays,</a> which both fall on September 25. The&nbsp;Chicago&nbsp;actress posted a video of the two of them in Sardinia wishing each other a happy birthday to celebrate the special day.
