There looked to be one or two sharp points on the end of it."</p><p>DCI Richard Vandenbergh, said: "Youth clubs are expected to be a place of safety, a sanctuary for young people to be themselves and develop their skills and talents.</p><p>"The two males who burst in, each armed with large knives, turned that on its head with their actions which were sadly witnessed by so many other people.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>"This attack was premeditated and this death underlines the vile nature of knife crime and the pain and terror it inflicts on communities.</p><p>"I would like to pay tribute to Glendon’s family for their dignity with which they have carried themselves throughout proceedings."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518530638-e1567633602123.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518789639-e1567633503825.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518789669-e1567633526367.jpg><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
