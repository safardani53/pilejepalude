Yes, many of you seem to paint me as a red flag/ f—k boy.</p><p>“But I’m actually a decent guy, and I only want to continue getting better. As we should all want for ourselves.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nayte proposed to Young to close out The Bachelorette Season 18 last year.</p><p>Mere weeks before they went their separate ways, <a href=#>Young lashed out in anger</a> over talk that their romance was on the brink.</p><p>“I went on the show with no expectations. Just an open mind and an open heart,” Olukoya continued over the weekend, giving Young a sweet shoutout for further opening up his heart.</p><p>“But figured if I find my person, then thank God I went. Yes, I truly believed Michelle was my person.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As you can see below, Nayte ran down a numbered-list of points that he wanted to make to the public.</p><p>At one juncture, he said that he and Young were going to shack up a few months ago — but the pair wanted to “get to know each other on a deeper level before taking the leap of living together.”</p><p>He also wrote:</p><p>“Yes, the pressures were insane for both of us. We tried. It didn’t work. We’re sad about it. We all grieve differently.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>While Olukoya acknowledged that he was “inexperienced with love” prior to joining The Bachelorette, he emphasized that he went on the program with “no expectations. Just an open mind and an open heart…”</p><p>And now?</p><p>“Michelle and I are going to move forward separately.</p><p>“Hearts are heavy, emotions are high, and we are dealing with this the best way we can…When we both started this journey, we were looking for our soulmates. Our forever. Our best friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Elsewhere, Nayte shot down the idea that their breakup had anything to do with their friends, including his fellow Season 18 castmates.</p><p>“Yes, I like to hang out with my guys. As she likes to hang out with her girls. Nothing wrong with that. If anything, super healthy.</p><p>“We are social people. Not everyone who goes to bars are cheaters.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Since the duo’s split, Olukoya has changed his Instagram bio, removing “THE Michelle Young Fan Account” mention that he added after his televised engagement.</p><p>“My name is Babatunde Olufemi Robert Nathaneil Olukoya, and I will never live my life based on how others think I should live it. Period,” e concluded his post.</p><p>“For kind people, sending kind things, and respecting both Michelle and I. THANK YOU.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In a June 17 statement, Nayte wrote that “hearts are heavy, emotions are high, and we are dealing with this the best way we can” in regard to himself and his now-former-fiancee.</p><p>He added back then:</p><p>“We genuinely fell in love, and we genuinely became each other’s best friends.</p><p>“Michelle and I will always cheer each other on, but moving forward, we will be cheering from a distance.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WDcLrAsqueZZ%2Bhwqy72JpkpZ2Rq7JuucRmmKWnnpp6qnnDoptmpp%2BpeqS0xJqrZqeeYrqqr8eeo6WdXa68trrGaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meri-brown-does-kody-even-love-me-anymore.html><span>←</span><span>Does Kody Even Love Me Anymore?!</span></a>
