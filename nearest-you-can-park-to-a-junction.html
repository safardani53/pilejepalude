This also includes pedestrian crossings and cycle routes".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>There are various kinds of junction such as the T junction, where the road you're on ends and you have to turn either right or left, or a Y junction, where a minor road joins a major one at an angle.</p><p>If you're not sure, you can double-check the different types, and the rules associated with them in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Highway Code</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxyhY9xbW9pY2S7pq3RnqqtZamkwm6vwKdkqZmioHq1u4yaZKOtnpjBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shel-rasten-19820331-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shel Rasten (Rock Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
