Since its release (and subsequent re-releases), the James Cameron-directed film has made more than $2.2 billion at the box office, and continues to hold a place in pop culture history thanks to its beloved stars, heartbreaking storyline and breathtaking cinematography.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Shawn Bradley Dating Now</h2><time>Jul 21, 2024</time>
