This has left 90 Day Fiance fans torn between the devil they know and the devil they don’t. So to speak.</p><p>Now, Paul has thrown a new allegation into the mix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On Monday, June 5, Paul Staehle took to his Instagram Story.</p><p>In addition to sharing a slew of new photos of Karine and their sons, he had a lot to say about the custody situation.</p><p>“Shockingly my cousin has taken my kids to Alabama,” Paul announced.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“So,” Paul continued on his Instagram Story, “CPS notified Karine [that] she will no longer get visits.”</p><p>This, explained, is “because our children are no longer in Kentucky.” And he says that this was not a coincidence.</p><p>“My cousin purposely took our kids out of state after a motion was filed for them not to leave Kentucky,” Paul accused. He said that the filing happened “so Karine could have her visits.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Now Karine gets no visits,” Paul lamented.</p><p>“[The] prosecutor wouldn’t hear Karine’s motion,” he complained.</p><p>Apparently, the judge was “saying to our lawyers that my cousin would be in court on the 7th, but in reality, she will be in Alabama.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Karine is court-ordered weekly visits,” Paul cited, “which my cousin is denying her.”&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Paul himself nearly faced jail time over contempt when he missed a visitation with his kids.</p><p>His hope is that Karine’s legal team will be able to “work on conempt of court charges” against his cousin “for violating several court orders.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Paul went on to cite the reasons for which he believes that his cousins have violated the family court judge’s instructions.</p><p>“Removing our children without the judge’s permission from Kentucky,” he listed. “Prevention of Karine’s visits.”</p><p>Paul added: “Not appearing in court since Zoom is banned in our hearings, among other things.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=#>In Touch Weekly reports</a> that Paul’s cousin and her husband filed a motion on May 22.</p><p>Their goal? To receive permanent custody of Pierre Staehle and Ethan Staehle, Paul and Karine’s young sons.</p><p>Clearly, they believe that they would be better parents to the boys than Paul or Karine. And they hope that family court agrees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Many fans are divided.</p><p>Paul and Karine have proven, time and time again, that they are unstable people. It is difficult to imagine that they are the best option. And Paul and Karine have both accused the other of being unfit. But that was in the past.</p><p>Meanwhile, Paul’s cousins are unknown quantities. We hope that, whatever the court decides, it’s what’s best for Pierre and Ethan.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WDcLzArqNmq6SWsqm4xGaksmWTpMK0tc1mq6inm2K6unnKopusZZGYv7C%2F0maqrZmkmnqttc2eqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-the-super-mario-movie-cast-chris-pratt-charlie-day-more.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Super Mario Movie Cast: Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, More</span></a>
