It’s on my arm.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> quipped that “it is somewhat embarrassing” that Malone lost to Kelce, 34, and Mahomes, 28. “No, it’s not!” Malone replied. “They’re athletes! They’re athletes!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Post-Malone-Got-a-Kansas-City-Chiefs-Tattoo-As-Punishment-for-Losing-Beer-Pong-with-Travis-Kelce-439.jpg><p>“But you’re a legendary beer drinker,” Stern, 69, said. “You drink a lot of alcohol. What is this, you became a dad and now your beer pong [game] is diminishing, is that happening too?”</p><p>Malone <a href=#>welcomed his first child</a>, a daughter, with his fiancé in May 2022. He did acknowledge that his beer pong skills have been impacted since the arrival of his little one. “I think it does automatically take two points off,” he said.</p><p>The “Sunflower” singer then publicly requested a do-over with Mahomes and Kelce, who’s <a href=#>recently been linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><p>“I will say this, and I told Taylor to tell him, ‘Those elbows were crazy,’” he said of the game. “And you can’t have your elbows crossing over the table. So I’d like a rematch.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Post-Malone-Got-a-Kansas-City-Chiefs-Tattoo-As-Punishment-for-Losing-Beer-Pong-with-Travis-Kelce-442.jpg><p>Malone said he approves of Kelce’s budding romance with the “Cruel Summer” singer and went on to call Kelce the “sweetest dude.”</p><p>“Nowadays you really never know,” he said. “You meet a lot of people in the world. And what’s cool is, like, it’s cool to see people that are successful, much like Taylor and Travis and Patrick, they really give a s–t about human beings. And I think that’s pretty badass.”</p><p>Malone is not the only friend of the pair to think they are a good match. A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that their pals think they’re great together.</p><p>“They’re supportive of each other and they don’t have to be by each other’s side all the time and that feels comfortable,” the insider said earlier this month. “They plan to carve out moments to spend together to get to know each other better.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Even with the relationship recently beginning, the insider added that it’s “going great.”</p><p>“It’s still so new, but they really like each other,” they said. “They both want to try to see each other when they can and they’re both understanding of each other’s schedules.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapp6Opeq6ty6ilnmWXpMFuwMCtq6inXZaztbHRZqOoq5mjtG6uxK1kraddqb%2BiwsisZKSdnJiycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./married-twice-is-eric-benet-happy-with-wife-manuela-testolini-their-relationship-and-children.html><span>←</span><span>Married Twice, Is Eric Benet Happy With Wife Manuela Testolini?
