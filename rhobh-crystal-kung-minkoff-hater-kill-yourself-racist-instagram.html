PLEASE do the world a favor and kill yourself.</p><p>“You stupid, worthless nasty a** Asian s***h napkin. I feel sorry for your children…&nbsp;</p><p>“They have to wake up everyday knowing that their mother is a spineless, worthless piece of Asian s**t,” the repulsive DM concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to the hateful words, Crystal fired back: “What I can tell you “Dashie Pants”, is that my children are doing just fine.&nbsp;</p><p>“In fact, they are learning to speak out and stand up against racism. And they will certainly become allies for all races because God knows we need them more than ever based on your Facebook message.”</p><h2>SUPPORT FROM A FELLOW HOUSEWIFE</h2><p>She was met with support from many of her followers, including Real Housewives Of New York star Eboni K. Williams.&nbsp;</p><p>The New Yorker said: “You are so loved Sis. These deranged bigots are just mad AF that their days of dominance are coming to an end."</p><p>Dorothy Wang wrote: “Though you are strong, brave, and always find the perfect words to say-&nbsp;</p><p>“I am so sorry you have to endure this type of senseless hate! Bravo for always standing up and speaking out. Love you!”</p><p>She thanked her supporters following the messages and called to stop Asian hate.&nbsp;</p><p>“I want to say thank you to everyone who has DM’d me. It’s been hundreds. And I read them all.&nbsp;</p><p>“Your support lifts me up and reminds me to keep the conversation going. We will not be silenced.&nbsp;#StopAsianHate,” she wrote in her updated caption.&nbsp;</p><h2>BREAKING BOUNDARIES</h2><p>Earlier this year, Crystal made history when she became the first Asian American cast member to be featured on <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In May, Crystal’s on-camera nemesis, <a href=#>Sutton Stracke, was forced to apologize</a> to her rival after making insensitive comments about race.&nbsp;</p><p>The Southerner received backlash as she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">compared Asian stereotyping to being called a redneck</a> during a group trip to Lake Tahoe and also said she “doesn’t see color.”</p><p>Sutton, 50, took to&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;to express an apology to her cast mate and her fans as she called her actions “disrespectful."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"Despite Crystal and my strained relationship at the time, it was disrespectful to interrupt her and not listen to her express her truth," the reality star began.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"My life is blessed by the diversity of my relationships and I am committed to become a better listener to understand the painful realities experienced by people of color," she continued.</p><p>"I am sorry.
