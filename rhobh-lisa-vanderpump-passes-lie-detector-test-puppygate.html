What do I have to do, take a lie detector test? Alright then!” Vanderpump told audiences before the exam.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By her side was John Sessa, Executive Director of her Vanderpump Dogs organization, who also had his name dragged into the PuppyGate drama.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She’s been friends with these women, some of them for over 10 years. So it’s been awful that your closest friends are accusing you of something that you know you didn’t do,” Sessa told John, the polygraph examiner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to the test, Sessa also made sure John was equipped with all the questions he would need.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s almost 100 percent [accurate],” the examiner explained. “This is going to be scored as if it were a serious legal or criminal test, using federal guidelines. I’m neutral, but I’ve been testing for over 40 years. If she’s lying, I’m going to catch it in a second. If she’s telling the truth, she’s going to pass.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the high stakes, Vanderpump wasn’t worried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I know I’m 1,000 percent not guilty or else why would I volunteer for it?” she said. “I’m not as stupid as I look!”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lisa Vanderpump.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the exam, she remained cool, calm, and collected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, she was asked base questions like, “Do you live in Texas?” and “Are you in California?” and “Do you know how to drive a car?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sessa threw at least one pointed question in there too: “Do you think Dorit’s face has changed in the last year as much as her accent?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She’s had a head transplant!” Vanderpump joked, before throwing some shade at costar <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Erika Girardi</a>. “Just don’t ask me if Erika’s tucking it under or something like that because there are some things I can’t lie about.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, the polygraph examiner got to the good questions: “Have you ever given a story to Radar Online about <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dorit Kemsley</a> abandoning her dog to a shelter?”; “Do you know who gave a story to Radar Online about Dorit abandoning her dog?”; “Do you think you will ever forget the hurtful accusations made by your close friends?”; “Do you believe these women who have accused you of giving a story to Radar Online are your true friends?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To all those questions, Vanderpump said “no.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lisa Vanderpump.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gabriel Olsen/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So was she lying? According to John the examiner, no.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve been testing over 30 years, I’ve tested over 10,000 people,” he said. “The scoring program agrees with me. It says there is zero chance you are lying on any of the questions of importance.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As expected, Vanderpump was thrilled with the news. “Oh yes!” she said. “That was so great.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Surprisingly, though, she didn’t have a plan for what she was going to do with the news. “I don’t know what I’m going to do with these results,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep it in my back pocket and shove it up their ass if ever I come across them, just to prove you bunch of a——- are barking up the wrong tree.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 9 cast.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bravo</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Vanderpump wasn’t rushing to tell her RHOBH costars just yet, the news of her polygraph got back to them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kyle Richards</a>‘ daughter happened to know someone who saw Vanderpump during the exam, and passed the news back to her mom. Richards then told Kemsley, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Lisa Rinna</a>, and Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave the scoop while they were all in Hawaii at Camille Grammer’s wedding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">None believed that an innocent result would exonerate Vanderpump, many pointing out that Vanderpump gave them the questions. “If Lisa were to hand me that piece of paper that said ‘Lisa passed with flying colors,’ do you think this is going to change anyone’s opinion?” said Richards, 50.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Lie detector tests aren’t even accurate,” said Mellencamp Arroyave, 37. “And you can train yourself to pass them! Ted Bundy passed!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Innocent people fail them all the time. Guilty people pass them. They’re not admissible in court,” Richards added. “She acts like she’s being accused of murder for God’s sake. … She’s trying to focus on something she can control like that instead of the actual problem which is the initial thing she did with you, the Vanderpup Dogs thing. Cause that’s the betrayal!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kemsley, 42, had a good question. “You can strip away all the he said/she said thing. Why do you think she does it?” she asked the group.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s how she looks to the world,” said Rinna, 55. “She wants to be perceived as perfect and a saint.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> airs Tuesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfLO0zpufZqSZqK5uwsCnm56qoKq6sXnPmqqsnaNiuaqxjJ2crZ2TqbyzedOeqq1loKq9scXGmqueZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-custom-swimsuit-mexico.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian's Wears a Custom White Swimsuit in Mexico</span></a>
