The actor, who struggled with addiction for years in the past, checked into a renewal facility this week, his rep confirms to Us Weekly.</p><p>The Oscar-winning actor, 62, reportedly chose on his own accord to spend some time away. He is believed to be at <a href=#>Hazelden's Dan Anderson Renewal Center</a> in Minnesota, a care facility that focuses "on common issues faced in recovery—spiritual fitness, emotional balance, healthy relationships, grief, meditation, and more…and [provides] a safe environment to map out personal paths to a more joyful, deeply satisfying recovery."</p><p>The comic icon, however, did not relapse. An insider tells Us that Williams' time at the center has been planned "for a long period of time" and was "not a last minute decision." The source adds that Williams' decision is akin to spending time at a yoga retreat—"it's a place to recharge," the insider explains. He will stay at the site for one to two weeks in the renewal center, as opposed to Hazelden's addiction treatment facility.</p><p>Williams reportedly has remained clean since he was last treated eight years ago, and is taking his trip to the facility as a continued step in his sobriety.</p><p>"After working back-to-back projects, Robin is simply taking the opportunity to fine-tune and focus on his continued commitment, of which he remains extremely proud," his rep tells Us Weekly in a statement.</p><p>The Crazy Ones star has been vocal about his past issues with cocaine, and checked into rehab in 2006 to work on alcohol problems.</p><p>"After 20 years of sobriety, Robin Williams found himself drinking again and has decided to take proactive measures to deal with this for his own well-being and the well-being of his family," his publicist said at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After his recovery, Williams spoke to <strong>Diane Sawyer</strong> about his personal struggles on Good Morning America. <a href=#>In the October 2009 interview</a>, he admitted that he thought he could handle his addiction, "but you can't."</p><p>"That's the bottom line," he added to Sawyer. "You really think you can, then you realize, I need help, and that's the word…It's hard admitting it, then once you've done that, it's real easy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Keu27DyKWjopmdqHqktMScoqxlmaPBsHnRnqWer5GheqSxza2cq2ViZX51fZZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-cried-over-nude-w-magazine-spread-in-2011-watch-video-20141411.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Cried Over Nude W Magazine Spread in 2011: Watch Video</span></a>
