The band are in Rome enjoying time in their home city before the madness of a busy year begins.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>David</a>, guitarist Thomas Raggi and drummer Ethan Torchio are cosied up on a sofa chatting to me through a video call.&nbsp;</p><p>Bassist Victoria De Angelis is absent through illness but the talkative trio are making up for their missing bandmate’s absence.</p><h2>‘Crazy stories of Mick and Keith’</h2><p>David adds: “In general our generation feels that we don’t need to be labelled any more and I think music reflects society. Today nobody cares if they’re rock, pop or whatever — they just want to enjoy music and that’s all that matters.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Music</h2></p><p>The band’s third album, Rush! includes rock, pop, funk and glam styles of songs and boasts 17 tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an album that proves Måneskin are going to be sticking around for a long time with high points including the beautiful ballad If Not For You, the punky number Mammamia and fan favourite Supermodel. David says: “Yeah, it’s a long album. But we wanted to make it the old-fashioned way.&nbsp;</p><p>“When people hear the album, it’s very clear that it’s a reflection of the whole band. We are all into different styles and instead of fighting over them, we put them all on there.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s an album that celebrates four individuals and how confident we are to show our different sides but are clearly Måneskin. You can hear all the fundamentals and foundations of the band on this record.”</p><p>David says: “First you have to pretend it’s not happening and try and keep things as normal as possible.” While Torchio adds: “When we opened the stadium [Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium] it was the first time we’d played a stadium.&nbsp;</p><p>Måneskin’s feet have not touched the ground since winning 2021’s Eurovision with a performance of Zitti e buoni at Rotterdam’s Ahoy Arena.</p><p>They’ve appeared on the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic and toured the world playing shows and festivals which has meant the flamboyant rock band have some “crazy stories” to tell, including meeting <a href=#>Mick Jagger</a> and Keith Richards when they supported the Rolling Stones and having breakfast with <a href=#>Chris Martin</a> and <a href=#>Dakota Johnson</a> at their LA home.</p><p>“And the crowd are there to see The Stones so it was a real challenge for us. But we did it and it was super fun and Mick and Keith were great — it was so iconic.”</p><p>And it was Torchio who ended up meeting Madonna in New York which he describes as another “crazy moment”.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Chris Martin invited us over’&nbsp;</h2><p>He says: “I went in her house in New York, it was completely random. I have some friends who know her and it was cool to meet her. It was a great experience.”</p><p>Then the band spent a morning with the Coldplay singer and his partner after both bands appeared at a festival in Vegas.</p><p>David says: “We were playing the iHeart festival and Chris Martin invited us over to his and Dakota’s house — Sean Penn was there too. And it wasn’t breakfast — we had brunch.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was very LA having brunch. Then we went to the beach and lost their dog. And then we found the dog.”</p><p>Having collaborated with legend Iggy Pop on their 2021 single I Wanna Be Your Slave, the band worked with another big name on Rush! — Rage Against The Machine’s Tom Morello for the track Gossip.</p><p>“Yes it’s another crazy story,” laughs Torchio. “We first met at our Roxy show in LA and then we spent three months there, so he came over and we were jamming together.&nbsp;</p><p>“The main riff of that song was written the day before but Tom made his mark on the song and because we were in the room together, there’s a real energy on that song.”</p><p>Raggi says there have been many highs being in Måneskin but they admit it has been difficult being away from loved ones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thomas-raggi-victoria-de-angelis-788990569.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/e4439520-416d-4972-969d-2b534821c5d9.jpg><p>One of the stand-out songs on Rush! is the stunning If Not For You which David says is “basically a love letter”.</p><p>“It can be lonely on the road,” he admits. “I’m lucky that we are friends and like family but there are times when it’s hard.&nbsp;</p><p>“Many artists are starting to share the negative parts as well&nbsp;as the beautiful parts of this life and I think it’s important to tell people when you’re not feeling well or are overwhelmed by the job, there are limits.&nbsp;</p><p>“It makes the connection with your fans more honest and empathetic. I admire what Shawn Mendes did [the singer postponed his live shows to focus on his mental health] and many artists are doing the same.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s brave and takes courage and shows responsibility. Moves like that are slowly going to change our environment and make it healthier.”</p><p>The album cover for Rush!, which shows a girl jumping over the band, is a picture everyone felt was right, says Raggi.</p><p>“It shows the girl holding on to her team which can be positive or negative.”</p><p>David adds: “Rush was the perfect word to sum up the last two years of our lives because we are always in a rush to the next thing taking a plane, car or train. All our days have been a rush.”</p><p>One favourite track on Rush! is <a href=#>Mark Chapman</a>, named after <a href=#>John Lennon</a>’s stalker and killer.</p><p>“The song talks about stalkers because I had a stalker and it scared the s**t out of me,” says David.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a topic that must be spoken about because I think, at times, there needs to be a healthier relationship between fans and celebrities. I think the tendency to idolise people like in the 70s and 80s is coming back and it is the unhealthiest thing.</p><p>“It drives fans to expectations and people do crazy things.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/maneskin-band-celebrates-stage-71th-706945794.jpg><h2>‘Gucci collaboration was huge opportunity’</h2><p>“I think that people need to be educated on how to interact and to understand when people are crossing the line.</p><p>“Artists need to understand the red flags and when to leave if they are getting hate or s**t.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s only a small number this refers to and more need to speak out about it.”</p><p>It’s not only in music where Måneskin have been making their mark. The good-looking band have also been gaining attention for their bold fashion and were personally picked by Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele to appear in the fashion label’s recent campaign.</p><p>David, sporting a newly shaven head, says: “Bands in the 70s and 80s looked good and sounded good — it was in their aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p>“Today people dress very simple and we’re not really into dressing simple. The Gucci collaboration was a huge opportunity for us.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NINTCHDBPICT000789397311.jpg><p>“They’re one of the biggest brands in the world and they’re Italian so it was perfect. We found beautiful people to work with a beautiful band.”</p><p>In May, Måneskin headline London’s O2 — just two and a half years after their first London gig at Tufnell Park’s Dome.</p><p>Torchio says: “We’ve played some big shows already — Rock Am Ring was mad and Rock in Rio was huge.”</p><p>“We are excited for the O2 as London is like our second home,” adds David. “You have to not think about it too much, because then you feel the pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t feel anything until I get on stage and everything starts. It’s such an adrenaline rush. But we are very carefree — we don’t really care about what people think.&nbsp;</p><p>“We just do what we feel like and try to enjoy it. That’s our attitude about everything.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“If we are loving our music and shows then our fans will too.”</p><ul><li><strong>Rush! is out today</strong></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYW19dHyVaKmom5tir6K6w6xknq2ipMOqv8iopWalkaOytLfIp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-fnaf-in-fortnite.html><span>←</span><span>FNAF Is Not Officially in Fortnite Yet</span></a>
