I literally stood&nbsp;up, had a sip of my cocktail.&nbsp;My eyes were looking at the bench and he&nbsp;was walking past but we never made eye contact,” Roni tells&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY. “As far as my seductive&nbsp;look, I actually just look that way [laughing]. In that shot&nbsp;everyone’s talking about, I was actually holding my boyfriend’s hand.&nbsp;He was to my left.” She made sure to note&nbsp;that she has ZERO&nbsp;connection to the basketball star, “I’ve never met him before in my life. I’m just a huge fan.”</p><h3 class=galleryh1>Roni Rose: See Pictures Of The Model That Flirted With Steph Curry Here</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>We’re sure that somewhat comes as a relief to Roni’s boyfriend and&nbsp;to Stephen’s wife <strong>Ayesha Curry</strong>, 27, who is also the mother to his adorable young children <strong>Ryan</strong> and <strong>Riley</strong>. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>questionably suggestive image</a> that rapidly circulated social media sites showed Roni in a blue crop-top and form-fitting canary yellow skirt. She was clearly representing her team pride for Golden State during game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals against the Oakland Cavaliers. Of course after seeing her presence at the game going viral, Roni took to Instagram to mock all of the negative attention and haters saying that she was trying to step in on Ayesha’s husband of five years. Roni&nbsp;used a screenshot&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>along with the&nbsp;explanation</a>:&nbsp;“S<span title=Edited>ooo I was just drinking my drink and this happened. I’m just giving the boys a little motivation I guess. Go warriors.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>[jwplatform YsBzHrHS]</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Roni even addressed&nbsp;that Stephen is so&nbsp;not her cup of tea in the looks department. “I personally think he resembles&nbsp;my four younger brothers. Plus, he doesn’t have any tattoos and he has&nbsp;a baby face. So no!”&nbsp;she tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com </strong>EXCLUSIVELY<strong>.</strong> Welp, it appears to be mutual between the two parties involved, considering the 6-foot-3 point guard <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>only has eyes</a> for his beautiful, classy wife. A&nbsp;source close to the MVP also told us&nbsp;that, “Steph&nbsp;doesn’t like this Ronigate scandal he’s found himself in. He appreciates her love as a fan but at the same time, he doesn’t like all the drama that’s been going on.&nbsp;Steph’s a married man and Ayesha’s his everything.”&nbsp;Awe!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you feel about Roni’s side of the story regarding her straw-sipping fiasco?
