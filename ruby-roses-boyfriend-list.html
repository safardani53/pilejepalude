Her given name is Ruby Rose Langenheim, and friends just call her Ruby.

You can learn more interesting insights about this date, as well as your own birthday, at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BirthdayDetails</a>.</p><p>Ruby was born in the Millennials Generation, her zodiac animal is a Tiger, and her spirit animal is a Wolf. People born in the year of the tiger are self-sufficient and have great self-esteem. They adore being the defender and leader of ordinary people. They are passionate about justice and will never give up an argument. Their main flaw is their recklessness, which causes them to fail. They never, however, genuinely fail. Tigers will always find a way to recover and triumph in the end.</p><p>People born on March 20 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Model and recording artist also known as a former DJ for MTV Australia. She released her debut single “Guilty Pleasure” in late 2012. She launched her fashion line, Milk and Honey Designed by Ruby Rose, in 2010. Her mother Katia Langenheim was a single parent. An open lesbian, Ruby Rose became engaged to fellow Australian model Catherine McNeil in 2010. She was later engaged to Phoebe Dahl in early 2014. They split in December of 2015.
