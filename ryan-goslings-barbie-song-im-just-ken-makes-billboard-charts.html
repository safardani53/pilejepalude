We got there organically,” director <a href=#><strong>Greta Gerwig</strong></a> told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> last month. “I think if I had said, ‘I want you to sing and dance in this movie,’ he would not have necessarily done that for me.”</p><p>Gerwig, 40, continued: “But it was kind of that thing of boiling a lobster. I think by the time he was singing and dancing, he didn’t even totally know how we had gotten there. But he’s so fabulous at it.”</p><p>“I’m Just Ken,” penned by <a href=#><strong>Mark Ronson</strong></a> and <strong>Andrew Wyatt</strong>, serves as a summary of Ken’s (Gosling) feelings throughout the film — which follows him and Barbie (<a href=#><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a>) as they travel to the real world to discover why she is malfunctioning. On the way, they learn things are not as perfect in real life as they are in Barbieland.</p><p>“[Mark and Andrew] didn’t even have all the lyrics,” Gerwig explained last month, noting that rock stars such as <a href=#>Meat Loaf</a> were among the songwriters’ inspirations. “They just had a feeling and the skeleton and the lyric ‘I’m just Ken,’ and it just evolved from there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Barbie-Im-Just-Ken-Earns-Ryan-Gosling-Billboard-Hot-100-Hit-3.jpg><p>Gosling sings more than once in the film. To impress the Barbies, Gosling and the other Kens serenade them with Matchbox Twenty’s 1996 track “Push.” Lead singer <a href=#><strong>Rob Thomas</strong></a> called <a href=#>the song’s inclusion in the movie “hilarious”</a> during an interview with <a href=#>USA Today</a>.</p><p>“When I got the call for Barbie, they told me, ‘Ken’s by the fireside, he’s playing the song and it’s his favorite band.’ So I did this thinking I’d be the butt of the joke, and I was fine with that,” Thomas, 51, noted. “I’m pretty thick-skinned. But <strong>Julie Greenwald</strong> (from Atlantic Records) came to the Hollywood Bowl a month or two ago. She had just seen the movie and was like, ‘You come out of it loving Ken and loving ‘Push.’’ And I was like, ‘Aww. Alright, really good!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The song’s role in Barbie was a match made in heaven for Thomas, as he told the outlet that Gerwig, “has been one of my crushes forever.” He added: “I was on a plane one time and I called my wife [<a href=#><strong>Marisol Maldonado</strong></a>], like, ‘Baby, Greta Gerwig just came on the plane, Oh, my God.’ So just the fact that it didn’t diminish my crush on Greta, that’s even better.”</p><p>Barbie opened in theaters on July 21 and made <a href=#>$162 million in its opening weekend</a>, becoming the biggest opening debut in history for a female-directed film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmymZ5itLC%2Fy6KloKtdl66zrsieZKynnpx6qrmMo6ysrF2gsq95zJqinqtdl7atuMGomKucXZi1or7TrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-elizabeth-scotland-break-before-coronation-family-corgis-king-charles-queen-camilla.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Elizabeth's Scotland Break Before Coronation,Like King Charles</span></a>
