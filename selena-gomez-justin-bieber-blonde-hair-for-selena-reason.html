He was always resistant to the idea so she thinks it’s strange that he would decide to dye his hair now. She’s surprised how blonde he went.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Justin is clearly using his new hair as a way to get her attention and Selena is well aware of it — he even went to her salon to get it done!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Selena thinks <span class=il>Justin</span> is trying to get her attention for sure. But if he wants to get back with her, he needs to try a lot harder than just getting his hair dyed,” our source added. We totally agree! Although we think it is kind of cute that Justin died his hair just for her, we think he may need to take things a step further to really win her back this time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Our source also shared, “She isn’t sure yet if she likes his new hair color. She just isn’t happy that he’s made no effort to get in touch with her.”<br></p><h3>Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber: His Promise To Her That He Just Broke</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Justin has let Selena down quite a few times recently, so like we said, he may have to do more than just dye his hair to win her back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>A source told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY, “He pretty much told Selena that if he couldn’t be with her, he wouldn’t want to be with anybody else. That he would just focus on his spiritual studies and church, until she came back to him. So much for that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The fact that he is been showing off his new relationship with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></a>, 18, just proves that he is not ready to get back together with Selena.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Justin dyeing his hair was a nice gesture to get Selena’s attention? Or do you think he needs to do a lot more to win her back?
