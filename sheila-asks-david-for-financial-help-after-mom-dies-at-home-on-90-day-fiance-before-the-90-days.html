Hours later, her mother passed away.</p><p>It was a tragic and perhaps inevitable fall in a house that was barely holding together and clearly unfit for human habitation.</p><p>Sheila doesn’t want to go back home until it’s fixed up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_01-1024x576.png><p>This sneak peek (you can see the full video below) of the Sunday, August 13 episode, Sheila and David have stopped for a casual drink.</p><p>Their translator is there with them, as she speaks Tagalog and is also fluent in ASL (American Sign Language).</p><p>Sheila is discussing the repairs that her family home (which her father built by hand).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_02-1024x576.png><p>It’s going to be expensive to make it into a less lethal residence, let alone truly livable.</p><p>David emphasizes this. We already saw her neighborhood and heard David’s description of the smell from the open sewage.</p><p>Even though the house is in what looks like a shantytown, it could be safer. Having steps up to code (literally any code) would help. And so would having a roof that isn’t shower curtains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_03-1024x576.png><p>Obviously, David would like to help. But there is only so much that he can do.</p><p>He warns Sheila that he “can’t pay for all of it.”</p><p>The project would be essentially building an entire house. Ideally involving plumbing and more amenities that it does not have at present.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_04-1024x576.png><p>There are definitely some things that don’t translate well between radically different cultures. Economics can be one of them.</p><p>David works two jobs, but while that means that he has a steady income, it doesn’t mean that he’s wealthy. (Generally, two jobs means that neither earns enough on its own)</p><p>But for Sheila, their disparate circumstances don’t always translate. The power of the American dollar can look great until you see a pizza delivery receipt for $30 and a rent bill of $1000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_05-1024x576.png><p>Speaking to the translator more than to David, Sheila admits how she is feeling.</p><p>She feels embarrassed to ask David at all.</p><p>Sheila and David really like each other. No one likes the humbling feeling of asking a loved one for financial help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_06-1024x576.png><p>But she, and David, both know that Sheila cannot do this herself.</p><p>She does not have a job right now. And not for lack of trying.</p><p>Meanwhile, David has two jobs. He doesn’t have much, but in comparison, he at least has his own income.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_07-1024x576.png><p>Sheila was gainfully employed before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>But this deadly virus killed a lot of people, disabled countless more, and shook up how a lot of businesses operate.</p><p>Right now, she has been unable to find work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_08-1024x576.png><p>David hopes that, by supporting her, he can keep her afloat until she can find work.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sheila wants to make one thing absolutely clear.</p><p>“If he can’t afford the expenses, it’s okay,” she affirms.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Sheila also wants to stress that she’s not trying to use David for his limited funds.</p><p>“I’m not after your money,” she says. Her fear is that David might think that.</p><p>He knows that. He just wants to find a realistic way to help with that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_david_sheila_promo_09-1024x576.png><p>No one realistically thinks that Sheila is a “gold digger.” David does not have gold for which to dig.</p><p>Meanwhile, the two of them clearly love each other. And they have a lot in common. They met because of their (lack of) hearing, not on a sugar baby website.</p><p>Neither of them expected this tragedy.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WFcL%2FHnqClmV2WwKy%2FjJ2Yr6GUYrOwvoyfoKeZnpi2oriMoZylqF2Ws7Wx0WakqKVdmbamv4yaq2agn6KybrvNZnBpZZSWxm6yyJqlnJ1dl7Knu9GeZK2glWKGcXnDmrCsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./moment-teen-killers-chase-rival-stab-death.html><span>←</span><span>Moment teen killers chase rival, 23, around ping-pong table then stab him to death The Sun</span></a>
