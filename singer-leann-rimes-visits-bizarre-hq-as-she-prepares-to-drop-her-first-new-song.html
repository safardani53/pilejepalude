I’ve gone through a lot, every transition and every feeling that goes along with being a child star.</p><p>"I can see now why at 33 things happened the way they did and all of these lessons I’ve learned. But it was hell at times.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict0002442902831.jpg><p>Five days ago, LeAnn tweeted a throwback photo with troubled star<strong> BRITNEY SPEARS</strong> at the 1999 Billboard Awards.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">'Love is love'</h3></p><p>THE singer has sent a message of love to the LGBT community after an IS gunman killed 50 in a gay nightclub in Florida on Sunday. She said: “It’s devastating. The most political I get is with the LGBT community and equal rights, equality is huge for me. I have such a fan base there and in my heart I’ve never understood that other point of view. Love is love and that’s it.”</p><br><p>I asked how her scale of meltdown compares. She told me: “Britney and I never spoke about it, but we should have. There’s nobody that really relates to that – most of them in that position are not with us anymore, because of that reason – being a child star. It’s a trippy place to be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000014959986.jpg><p>At breaking point, LeAnn checked into rehab. Anxiety issues were compounded by cruel “slut-shaming” after she cheated on first husband Dean Sheremet with actor <strong>EDDIE CIBRIAN</strong> – who she is now married to.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Safety fears</h3></p><p>LEANN was devastated to hear about <b>CHRISTINA GRIMMIE</b>, The Voice USA star shot dead while signing autographs at a gig in Florida on Friday. She said the attack heightened her fears over musicians’ safety. LeAnn said: “I’ve been doing this a long time, I’ve had run-ins with frightening people. You really never know what could happen.”</p><br><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>She adds: “I’m very happy now. We’ve been married for over five years and I have my two stepsons, but the shaming thing, that’s where I had severe anxiety and depression.</p><p>“It was a mistake but it also led me to my marriage. I didn’t know how to deal with that and it became this snowball effect.”</p><p>It’s great to have her back.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Bizmeter: LeAnn's fave Brits</h3></p><p><b>ADELE:</b> "I've loved her from the start. She is so ballsy. I met her at the Grammys once. I told her I was a huge fan and she went: 'Oh my god! I've had your picture on my wall since I was little.'"<br><b>David Gray:</b> "I was in Hawaii when I heard his song Babylon. We were driving to the beach and I turned back to buy it from the store. We played The One I Love at my wedding right after the kiss."<br><b>James Bay:</b> "When I heard Let It Go for the first time, I wore it out to the point where I can't listen to it anymore. When we talked about signing over here, he was the sound that inspired me."<br><b>Elton John:</b> "He's the ultimate icon. We used to talk all the time. I think all artists have been inspired by him. He's a risk taker and set the tone for his era. His outfits were incredible."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpYmyFdX2SaKqippeav264xJqlp2Winrqmv4yvoKyhpKh6o7XZmqmrnV2dvm6t0maqoZ1dpb%2BmvMCrnKxlpKR6pb7OqWShnaJis6q%2B0q1kp52nYsCwusZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mackinzie-dae.html><span>←</span><span>Mackinzie Dae- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
