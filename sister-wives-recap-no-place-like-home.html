This week on TLC’s Sister Wives, Kody Brown and his four wives paid a visit to his hometown (Lovell, Wyoming), which was a pretty big deal for the Brown Bomber and Co. because it was his “first time going back openly as a polygamist.”

Even if you don’t like what they do, they seen like nice people and are basically harmless, so c’est la vie.</p><p>A few people even congratulated Robyn on her pregnancy, while their critics basically concurred that these were good people who just had the “wrong idea.”</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>One woman was nervous that people might think that Lovell, Wyoming was the birthplace of polygamy. Not the case, sweetheart, it’s just the birthplace of TLC’s polygamist reality show … so basically the same thing in this era.<p>At a reunion of Kody Brown’s high school friends, which TLC clearly had no role in pulling together, they regaled the wives with stories of their husband in H.S.</p><p>He liked to be the center of attention, apparently. Says a lot.</p><p>When you’ve got four adoring wives and 17 kids clamoring for your time and love day in day out, that’s one way to be the focal point of your own little universe.</p><p>Kody’s best friend Ken had an interesting take on the Browns’ lifestyle: “We feel like he’s got an issue come Judgment day,” he said. “If he goes to hell, so be it.”</p><p>Pretty much, Ken. Pretty much.</p><p>Apparently some people thought Kody was “flamboyantly gay” in high school. The reason for that theory was that he wore “tight pants” and he “flipped” his hair.</p><p>It turns out he was just ahead of his time, though, trying to be fashionable as a man. In this day and age, we would merely term him … well, something else.</p><p>We never really got the gay vibe from the Kode-man, but the four wives will certainly dispel that notion fast. How much more straight can a guy be, right?!</p><p>He marries women and fathers their kids left and right! Speaking of which, Kody and Robyn plan to name their son Solomon. That sounds like a nice name.</p><p>Thoughts on this installment of Sister Wives? How do you think Kody’s trip home went? Do you like the name Solomon?
