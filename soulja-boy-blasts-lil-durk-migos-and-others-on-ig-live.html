In a recent Instagram Live, he discussed how he collaborated on songs with many rappers when they were relatively unknown, but they haven’t given him any credit or features since they rose to fame."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Take a look at Rich The Kid and me. Take a look at me and Mozzy. Take a look at me and Lil B. Take a look at me and Riff Raff. Famous Dex and I. “How many rapper n****s have I worked with before they got their record deal?”</p><p>“Take a look at me and Lil Durk. I was featured on Lil Durk’s debut mixtape. “Look at me and Chief Keef,” the rapper said before bringing up the Broadway Girls singer again.</p><p>“I write songs for all these n****s before they become famous.” Then, once they become famous, I can’t even get a song from them. That’s insane. But back when you all n****s were in the hood, and nobody knew who the f**k you all were, I was doing songs with you all n****s.”</p><p>Soulja Boy then went on to talk about how he assisted Lil Durk in his early days in the industry. “All a n**** has to do is Google Soulja Boy, Lil Durk, and “Eater.” This is this man’s first mixtape. Nobody had any idea who this man was.”</p><p>Soulja Boy’s facts are a little skewed in this case because he appeared on Durk’s third mixtape, Life Ain’t No Joke. I’m a Hitta, and I’m Still a Hitta were his first two commercial mixtapes, and both of them helped the rapper become well-known.</p><h2>A Look At Lil Durk’s Eater Ft Soulja Boy</h2><p>The remix was included on the rapper’s 2012 mixtape Life Ain’t No Joke.</p><p>Other songs on the mixtape included F**k Em (featuring French Montana), Days of Our Lives Lyrics, Animal Lyrics, and Homicide. “Riding around with one-hundred and fifties; they riding around saying we did it for the city,” Soulja Boy says in Eater. Riding around with a cocked hammer; Stacks On Deck, we’re on top; and me and Lil Durk aren’t going anywhere.” The full lyrics can be found on Genius. It should be noted, however, that explicit language has been used.</p><h2>Fans Support Lil Durk After Soulja Boy’s Ranting</h2><p>As soon as Soulja Boy began slamming Lil Durk, the majority of fans sided with him.</p><p>“If Lil Durk wasn’t on fire right now, Soulja Boy wouldn’t have mentioned his name, and I never heard a Soulja x Durk collab,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“You deserve a prize if you can recite a @souljaboy lyric that isn’t ten years old,” another fan said.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>If you can recite a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@souljaboy</a> lyric that isn’t 10 years old you deserve a prize</p><p>— Indicarloss (@indicarlosss) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 30, 2022</a></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqqK2cn65urs6yZJukkajBtHnLoqNmnKWnuG65yKCmrGWRo7Fuu9OhnKurXaS7brXGZqOirpVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reba-mcentires-boyfriend-rex-linn-and-her-past-marriages.html><span>←</span><span>Rex Linn and Her Past Marriages Hollywood Life</span></a>
