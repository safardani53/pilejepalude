Buckles Lane in South Ockendon is thought to be the largest traveller site in Europe and is home to more than 1,000 people.
In the 1980s, permission was granted for 50 caravan pitches for travelling showmen to use during the winter months.
But through the years, the site has more than doubled in size, often without planning permission, with an estimated 350 families living on 120 pitches."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
