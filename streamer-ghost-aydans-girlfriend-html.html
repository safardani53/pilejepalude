She is&nbsp;a full-time Twitch streamer and has also appeared in his YouTube videos and Twitch streams.</p><h2>Aydan Conrad First Met His Girlfriend at an Airport</h2><p>Conrad is currently in a relationship with Danielle Sweets, who he claimed&nbsp;to have first met in an airport. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a 2019 YouTube video, while&nbsp;introducing his girlfriend, the YouTuber shared that he met Sweets when flying for a tournament. The two were sitting at a Starbucks in the Chicago airport.</p><p>The duo seemed to have known each other&nbsp;before because the streamer mentioned&nbsp;calling Sweets at the airport to meet beforehand. Sweets&nbsp;denied that the meeting counted&nbsp;as a date, but her boyfriend insisted that it was one because of the effort she put into meeting him.</p><p>[Danielle] came for three hours to the airport. That is a date!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>In the same video, he&nbsp;also mentioned&nbsp;that they started dating around July "of last year," i.e., 2018, although he did not seem to recall exactly when. This means the streamer pair&nbsp;have been together&nbsp;for around three and a half years as of this writing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Aydan and Dani&nbsp;Live with Their Two Dogs</h2><p>Conrad and Sweets' relationship has come a long way from their first airport meeting—they now live together.</p><p>Several of the streamer and his girlfriend's Twitter posts reveal that they also have two dogs: Bambi and Thumper. Thumper seems to be a recent addition because the streamer&nbsp;mentioned in a 2019 YouTube Q&A video that he was "not ready" for two dogs back then.</p><p>The couple also confessed that when Bambi was a pup, he was why the couple got into so many arguments. On top of that, raising two dogs was something that neither of them could afford at the time, both financially and time-wise.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Understandably, taking care of a young pup demanded that they take a lot of time and dedication out of their already busy schedule. Going by simple maths, getting another dog meant that all of those efforts would double up. Still, somewhere along the line, the couple managed to look past all of that and decided to get another fur baby anyway.</p><h2>Danielle Sweets Is a Twitch Streamer, Too!</h2><p>Sweets&nbsp;is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitch streamer</a> who plays several games, including Rust, Minecraft, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare, and most importantly,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Fortnite</a>. Her Twitch account reveals that she played games since she was five when she got a Nintendo DS.</p><p>In addition to that,&nbsp;her&nbsp;Twitter account has a flag of Cambodia and Vietnam, suggesting that she is probably from one or both of those countries. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moving on, since both&nbsp;Sweets and&nbsp;Conrad&nbsp;are Twitch streamers, they have crossed paths several times in their streaming pursuits. In fact, Conrad&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">once said</a> that their full-time streaming job made it difficult for them to raise their dog leading to several arguments. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even so, Sweets&nbsp;is ever <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">supportive</a> of her boyfriend's career pursuits, and Conrad has also made appearances in his girlfriend's&nbsp;YouTube channel through challenges and Fortnite streams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBs7HAppyrZZedvLTAjJqwnZmeqHqotdGlnauhlaOxb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ruel-hamilton.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Ruel Hamilton net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
