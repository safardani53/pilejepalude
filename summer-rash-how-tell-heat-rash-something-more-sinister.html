when you sit in the sun for periods of time during the spring to toughen the skin.</p><h2>Phytophotodermatitis</h2><p>Phytophotodermatitis happens when sunlight reacts with plant compounds.</p><p>These include foods like figs, citrus fruits, carrots and celery.</p><p>Dr Kaye said: “Gardeners can get it on their hands – giant hogweed is a common cause, as is rhubarb.</p><p>“Citrus fruits can also trigger the reaction, which is why we often see it round the mouths of children who have been eating ice lollies made with real limes or lemons.”</p><p>Bartenders, food handlers and grocery workers may also be affected if they work in the sunshine.</p><p>Sometimes people have no idea what has caused their rash because they may not recollect coming into contact with the substance.</p><p>It also<a href=#> goes by the name of “margarita rash” </a>because the cocktail, made using limes, could lead to blistering around the lips.</p><p>The rash can come up within 24 hours of exposure, but last several weeks.</p><p>The rash causes:</p><ul><li>Blister-like patches at the start that are irregularly shaped (sometimes in the same pattern as where the substance touched the skin, such as drips)</li><li>Redness</li><li>Swelling</li><li>Pigmentation that can last several months after healing</li></ul><h2>Jock itch</h2><p>Jock itch is a fungal infection that is more common in humid temepratures.</p><p>It starts when bacteria grow in a damp, close environment.</p><p>The rash is typically<a href=#> seen in the groin area </a>and often in athletes.</p><p>And the fungus can be passed between people through items like towels - similar to athlete's foot.</p><p>Those most at risk include men, people who are young, sweat heavily, have a weaker immune system or diabetes.</p><p>The rash starts as a reddened area of skin in the crease in the groin and may spread to the upper thigh in a half-moon shape.</p><p>Symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Burning</li><li>Itching</li><li>Skin that becomes flaky or scaly</li><li>Redness</li><li>Rash that gets worse with exercise or activity</li><li>Changes in skin colour</li><li>Doesn’t improve with steroid creams</li></ul><p>Although a “fungal infection” may make your skin crawl, jock itch is quite mild.</p><p>Most people find that topical antifungal medicines, and keeping the area dry and clean, help it to go away.</p><p>“Showering or washing daily, drying off thoroughly and getting out of damp clothes quickly are the best forms of prevention,” Dr Kaye said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000667116482.jpg><h2>Insect bites or stings</h2><p>When the weather heats up, <a href=#>the bugs come out</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Insect bites and stings</a> will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy.</p><p>It usually goes away within a few hours or days.</p><p>But some people will have an allergic reaction, either causing mild symptoms such as swelling, or severe symptoms.</p><p>Dr Kaye told The Sun: “Anaphylaxis from a <a href=#>wasp sting </a>would be an emergency.”</p><p>Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction include:</p><ul><li>Breathing difficulties</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Swollen face or mouth</li><li>Feeling sick or being sick</li><li>A fast heart rate</li><li>Difficulty swallowing</li><li>Loss of consciousness</li></ul><p>If someone has symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should call 999 and use an adrenaline auto-injector if the person has one.

Examples of rashes caused by infection include scarlet fever, measles, mononucleosis, and shingles.</li><li><strong>The rash is sudden and spreads rapidly.&nbsp;</strong>This could be the result of an allergy. Allergies to medications are common, and some can be serious. If breathing becomes difficult, call 999.</li><li><strong>The rash begins to blister.&nbsp;</strong>If your rash is made up of blisters, or if the rash turns into open sores, it could be the result of an allergic reaction, a reaction to medication, or an internal cause. Seek medical attention if a blistering rash affects the skin around your eyes, multiple areas in your mouth, or your genitals.</li><li><strong>The rash is painful.&nbsp;</strong>Painful rashes should quickly be evaluated by a doctor.</li><li><strong>The rash is infected.&nbsp;</strong>If you have an itchy rash and you scratch it, it may become infected. Signs of an infected rash are yellow or green fluid, swelling, crusting, pain, and warmth in the area of the rash, or a red streak coming from the rash.</li><h2>Solar urticaria</h2><p>Urticaria is a condition the leads to itchy hives, weals or nettle rash.</p><p>Some people's urticcaria is <a href=#>triggered by exposure to sunlight</a>, as well as the cold, wind, water, food, medicine, sweat and plants.</p><p>The sun causes cells in the skin to release histamine, causing a rash within minutes, according to the British Association of Dermatologists.</p><p>The main symptoms of solar urticaria are:</p><ul><li>Flat red marks or raised red/white weals on the skin</li><li>Itching, stinging or burning skin</li><li>Rarely the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and low blood pressure.</li></ul><p>Urticaria is difficult to treat and becomes a lifelong problem for most sufferers.</p><p>It involves avoiding the source of the condition - those with solar urticaria need to stay in the shade, cover themselves in clothes and suncream and sometimes take medication.</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>Itchy skin, in rare circumstances, can be a sign of <a href=#>cancer</a>.</p><p>For example one in three people with<a href=#> Hodgkin lymphoma get itchy skin</a>, which feels a bit like heat rash.</p><p>Leukemias and lymphomas, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic and liver cancer also cause itchy skin, sometimes as a result of build-up of bile salts or substances secreted by a tumour.</p><p>Itchy skin could also be <a href=#>a sign of skin cancer</a> if it comes with a new skin growth, change in mole, a sore that won't heal, rough or scaly skin patch or pink bump that bleeds easily.</p><h2>Xeroderma pigmentosum</h2><p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a very rare inherited skin disorder where the person is extra sensitive to the DNA damaging effects of UV.</p><p>Dr Kaye said even light bulbs can exacerbate the condition.</p><p>She told The Sun: “About half of patients will have blistering type burns after even a small amount of sun exposure but the other half won't.”</p><p>The half that don’t get blistering burns in the sun get a tan.</p><p>But both types of reactions also result in lentigos (freckling) of the skin the appear before the age of two years old.</p><p>People are usually diagnosed by the age of two years old.</p><p>They may have severe sunburn after their first time in the sun.</p><p>Symptoms of XP include:</p><ul><li>Blistering burns on exposed skin, sometimes after less than 10 minutes in the sun, typically of the skin, eyelids and tip of the tongue.</li><li>Thin skin</li><li>Pigmentation</li><li>Red lines and patterns on the skin caused by widened blood vessels</li><li>Dry skin and eyes</li><li>The eyelids and the surface of the eyes will usually be affected within the first decade of life</li><li>Hearing loss</li><li>Progessive mental impairment</li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Dr Kaye said: “[It] causes premature skin ageing and increased risk of skin cancers.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>People with XP have a 10,000-fold increased risk for developing skin cancer, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.</p><p>They also have a 2,000-fold increased risk for cancer of the eye and surrounding tissues.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Man gets ‘rare’ severe rash all over body and says his ‘skin peeled off’ after Johnson and Johnson vaccine</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BubWxxZW1%2BcL%2FUpqSeql2nrrS0jKGmsGWkmrmteceemK1lopbAqXnSqKSerJieu6h5zKipnmWjnruqv9OeqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meri-brown-reacts-to-not-being-invited-to-christine-browns-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>Meri Brown Reacts to Not Being Invited to Christine Browns Wedding Hollywood Life</span></a>
