The beloved Three’s Company&nbsp;actress, who was one day away from her 77th birthday, had struggled with different types of cancer in her younger years, and she had also been recovering from a neck injury, which required surgery, in 2020. Over the years, she’s been very outspoken on her opinions on<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> different types of treatment</a> for cancer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Suzanne had been absent from her Facebook Live series <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with her husband</a>&nbsp;<strong>Alan Hamel</strong>, for a while before her death, but still occasionally shared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>videos</a> on Instagram. Alan revealed that she had battled cancer again recently and had been cleared at the beginning of June in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>&nbsp;on July 31, 2023. Find out more about Suzanne’s health here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/suzanne-somers-health-cancer-ss-embed.jpg><h2>Suzanne Somers Diagnosed With Breast & Skin Cancer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Suzanne had been very open about her struggles with cancer. Her husband revealed that she did battle skin cancer when she was in her 30s, and she had a battle with breast cancer in her 50s, which she was very open about. Her husband also said that she was diagnosed with hyperplasia in her 20s, which he called “the waiting room for cancer.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>She was open about her breast cancer diagnosis. In her 2010 book Knockout,&nbsp;she opened up about alternative cancer treatments to chemotherapy, where she interviewed many doctors about different routes, although her advice was criticized by some experts, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She also strongly supported embracing a chemical-free, organic lifestyle. “All her doctors said if she didn’t lead a chemical-free, organic life supported by bioidentical hormones, she wouldn’t be with us,” her husband told Page Six.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>She also advocated for bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. “As we decline, we can now fill the tank with bioidentical hormones; not too much, not too little – exactly; optimal health. It’s the most exciting thing that’s ever happened. It means that we can remain even all the way through, and as you get older you just need a little more,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Park</a>&nbsp;magazine in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/suzanne-somers-health-cancer-ss-embed2.jpg><h2>What Are Breast Cancer & Skin Cancer?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer. Behind skin cancer, it’s the most common form of the disease found in women in the United States, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Mayo Clinic</a>.&nbsp;The disease occurs when the cells grow abnormally, and it can be inherited. Some symptoms can include a lump, changes to skin around the breast, and redness. There has been much research into breast cancer and preventative treatment.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Similar to breast cancer, skin cancer occurs when epidermis cells grow abnormally, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Skin Cancer Foundation.&nbsp;</a>It can be caused by UV rays from the sun or tanning bands. There are various types, including carcinoma and melanoma.</p><h2>How Long Has Suzanne Somers Been Sick?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/suzanne-somers-health-cancer-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>While it’s not clear how long Suzanne was battling the most recent bout of cancer, she revealed that she had been diagnosed with stage II breast cancer for the first time in April 2000. She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>underwent a lumpectomy</a> and radiation treatment, although she didn’t undergo chemotherapy, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;She revealed that doctors had told her that her cancer had taken a turn for the worst in 2008. “For six days, six doctors confirmed I had inoperable cancer. I went into that valley of fear.<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> I saw my death,</a> it was horrible,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a>&nbsp;in 2009. Thankfully, she later learned that she’d been misdiagnosed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Besides her cancer, Suzanne also had to undergo neck surgery in 2020, after suffering a fall down her stairs. “I have been struggling for the better part of the year with a fractured hip, and then Alan and I took an unfortunate fall while coming down the stairs at our home. I had an intense amount of pain after the fall that was not resolving,” she wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “After several scans, it was determined I had 2 vertebrae out of place which was causing pressure on nerves and creating that tremendous pain. The good news is that I had neck surgery to correct these issues and now I am on the mend!”</p><h2>How Is Suzanne Somers Doing Today?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>While she took some time off of work, Suzanne’s husband said that she was cancer-free. “She has now dealt with her cancer once again,” he told Page Six.&nbsp;“On June 6, she got an all-clear, but cancer is tricky and we will now closely monitor everything going forward.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Even though the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Three’s Company&nbsp;star</a> had been cleared, Alan revealed that the two of them were still taking a little time to recover. “We decided to put work on the back burner for now and focus on her health,” he told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Most recently, Suzanne took to Instagram on Jul. 31, 2023, to reveal with her followers more details about her current health battle. “Since I have been taking time off from work, many of you have asked for more details about my health. As you know, I had breast cancer two decades ago, and every now and then it pops up again, and I continue to bat it down,” she captioned<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a photo</a> with her husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>“I have used the best alternative and conventional treatments to combat it. This is not new territory for me. I know how to put on my battle gear and I’m a fighter. Alan has been by my side every step of the way. I can’t even explain how much he has done for me,” she went on to write. The starlet went on to express her gratitude for her family’s support.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>“If it’s even possible, we are even closer than ever. My incredible family has been so supportive, and have helped so much by keeping the business running so you can still have access to all the wonderful products,” Suzanne said. “Thank you for the continued love and support. It’s only about who you love and who loves you – and I love you!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KusZqmnpp6tLvMnqmsZZiarq3Ax2ZsamxkZoByew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dorion-renaud.html><span>←</span><span>Dorion Renaud</span></a>
