I made that b-tch famous”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1024x890.jpg><p>Not the classiest line, but this is Kanye we’re talking about — he’s probably said worse since waking up this morning.</p><p>The reason those gross lyrics are still being discussed seven years later is that Kim posted a video of a phone call between West and Swift in which Taylor seemed to approve of the line before the song’s release.</p><p>We later learned, however, that the video had been edited, and Taylor had no prior knowledge of Kanye’s plan to call her a b-tch on his album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1730743172-1024x728.jpg><p>Not surprisingly, it seems that the situation took a major emotional toll on Swift.</p><p>“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she told Time of the incident.</p><p>“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1719487460-1024x683.jpg><p>Taylor went on to explain that she went into seclusion as a result of Kim and Kanye’s smear campaign.</p><p>“I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year,” the singer said.</p><p>“I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1797933742-683x1024.jpg><p>According to a <a href=#>new report</a> from TMZ, Taylor’s irritation is partially due to the fact that Kim has never apologized for her role in Kanye’s nonsense.</p><p>Even after getting called out in the most high-profile celebrity interview of the year, it seems that Kim still has no intention of making things right with Taylor.</p><p>Obviously, Kim has been through all sorts of PR ups and downs over the course of her career, so she might just be shrugging this situation off as another temporary setback.</p><p>But the wrath of Swifties might prove to be more than Kim can handle!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2FcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aZpZmjqcBut8imZKSZopmutLTImqVmq5iaerWxwKacnWWlpXq4tdOhZKSZnq6ybsDOZqmuoZ5iurp50Z6nrqyRqbawuo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./euromillions-results-numbers-december-8.html><span>←</span><span>EuroMillions results and numbers: National Lottery draw tonight, December 8, 2023</span></a>
