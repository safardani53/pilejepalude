Tamron joined Sunny and her fellow panelists on Wednesday's edition of The View, where she was asked about her not so &#34;linear&#34; broadcasting career.
Halfway through the interview, Sunny, 53, said: &#34;Well, you and I have been friends for a while, we know each other well, and I'm always been impressed by your resilience.
&#34;Because like all of us, your career has not been linear, it hasn't always been easy…&#34;"><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Is that what you're saying? 'Your career has not been linear', that means you got fired!"</p><p>Keeping a very straight face, Sunny replied: "I got fired at CNN too! You know that!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUNNY HOSTIN">READ MORE SUNNY HOSTIN</h2><p>The <a href=#>mother-of-two</a> went on: "And after you left The Today Show... or was fired, whichever way you'd like to say it," but was interrupted by Tamron again.</p><p>"I made a linear move!" the mom-of-one said, as she mimicked Sunny's words.</p><p>Not looking overly impressed, <a href=#>Sunny</a> responded: "This is what you said and I loved it… you said you had to carve out your own path to success.</p><p>"So what's your message to other women about how to pick themselves up if their lives don't go the way they thought it would? Because that was your show, and then all of a sudden it wasn't."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Tamron replied: "Listen, life, we all have an idea of our plan, like, 'this is how it's going to work out,' and we all see the plan is not always what we think it will be.</p><p>"I've learned... I'm now 52 years old and never more have I learned to bet on myself and you have to bet on yourself," she continued as the audience applauded her.</p><p>Tamron, who recently <a href=#>debuted a blonde hairdo</a>, added: "The one thing I want my son to know is that I bet on myself and that I had joy in my life. Yeah, we have hills and valleys, we have tribulations and trials but I want him to see a clip of me on this show and think 'my mum had a great time.'</p><p>"Because I want him to know that it paid off, not in money, not in the name of a TV show, it paid off with my dignity and that's what matters."</p><h2>TAMRON ON TODAY</h2><p>Tamron first premiered as co-anchor of Today's Take (The Today Show's third hour with Natalie Morales, Al Roker and Willie Geist) in February 2014.</p><p>She was the first African American woman to co-anchor Today.</p><p>However, in February 2017, after the network gave her Today co-hosting slot to Megyn Kelly, Tamron opted out of her contract and decided to leave NBC rather than take a lesser role.</p><p>Tamron previously said that her sudden exit from The Today Show left her “heartbroken.”</p><p>"I was heartbroken," she told USA Today about the network’s decision.</p><p>"[Imagine] you've been putting in the work, and suddenly your employer says they're phasing you out. I had some suspicions because I'm a reporter and I'm pretty intuitive, but no one wants to lose their job.</p><p>“It wasn't about who I was losing it to – it was like a relationship where you're putting in 100 percent and the person who's putting in less has the nerve to break up with you."</p><h2>THE 'FIRING'</h2><p>In September 2019, she debuted her new daytime talk show produced by ABC, Tamron Hall, and wasted no time rehashing how she got there.</p><p>She claimed to the audience and viewers at home, she was "fired" by NBC.&nbsp;</p><p>"I go to work one day. I left fired. 'Demoted,' I guess is what they called it. I called it fired. Inside, I was falling apart. I had worked since I was 14," she said.</p><p>"I think it was being willing to be vulnerable, being willing to say that it was embarrassing, it hurt, I was on the mat, but having people around me say, 'You don't have to stay down'," Tamron said about the exit.</p><p>"And that really is what our show is about. At your lowest point, you’re not the only one going through that."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Back in 2020, <a href=#>Tamron was forced to deny</a> that she had fired 20 people from her talk show amid the Covid pandemic.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sunny is no stranger to drama and just last month she was accused of <a href=#>coming after her co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin</a> just for ratings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/tamron-hall-sunny-hostin-view-766322840.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/view-fans-blast-whoopi-goldberg-765925672.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/tamron-hall-new-daily-destination-758530741.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huY22GdIKQaKuhnV2rtqbDjKGmrKxdqMKvuthmn6irpJ67bsDApqmopl2drq24jK2mnZmpYsCpu9Zo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-is-taylor-swift-going-on-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Has No Shortage of New Music for a Future Tour</span></a>
