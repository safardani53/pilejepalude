In the decades since Titanic's release, she's become one of the most respected actresses in Hollywood. She won an Oscar in 2008 for The Reader (that is, after racking up five other nominations — and one more since then), as well as Golden Globes in 2022 for Mare of Easttown, 2016 (for Steve Jobs), 2012 (Mildred Pierce) and two in 2009 (The Reader and Revolutionary Road, which saw her teaming up with her Titanic costar <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>) and Emmys in 2011 for Mildred Pierce and 2021 for Mare of Easttown. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>At the encouragement of her kids</a>, she joined Titanic director <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>James Cameron</a> for the second installment of his Avatar franchise, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Avatar: The Way of Water</a> (2022).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Winslet is married to businessman Edward Abel Smith (legally known as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ned Rocknroll</a> from 2008 to 2019), and has three children: Mia, Joe and Bear. Though she's a long way from her Titanic days, she's still super close with DiCaprio, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>walked her down the aisle at her wedding to Smith</a> and whom she still speaks fondly of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>during interviews</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leonardo-dicaprio-jack-dawson></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>20th Century Fox/Paramount/REX/Shutterstock; Michael Loccisano/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Winslet, DiCaprio's career took off after Titanic, and he became a frequent collaborator of famed director <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Martin Scorsese</a>, starring in several of Scorsese's movies like The Departed, Gangs of New York and The Aviator. After four Oscar nominations as an actor (and an additional one as a producer), DiCaprio finally won his long-awaited Oscar in 2016, for the film The Revenant, with Winslet cheering him on throughout awards season. He was nominated again for an Oscar for his role in 2019's Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. DiCaprio led a star-studded cast as an astronomy professor in Adam McKay's apocalyptic satire <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Don't Look Up</a> (2021) and joins fellow Scorsese regular <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Robert De Niro</a> in the director's 2023 crime drama, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Killers of the Flower Moon</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he's not making movies, DiCaprio is a vocal activist for taking action on climate change, speaking at the United Nations and hosting an annual auction to raise money for the cause. (And at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the Saint-Tropez event</a> in 2017, he reunited with Titanic costars Winslet and Billy Zane.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-billy-zane-caledon-hockley></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Billy Zane (Caledon Hockley)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>20th Century Fox/Paramount/REX/Shutterstock; David M Benett/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He played Rose's rich but unlikable fiancé in Titanic, but in real life, Zane isn't quite so evil.
