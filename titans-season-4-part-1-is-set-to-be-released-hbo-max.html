The beloved program has not aired in almost a year. After a lengthy wait, the new season is likely to surprise and delight fans with some exciting new plotlines and key DC characters, such as Lex Luthor (played by the brilliant Titus Welliver).</p><p>The fourth season will also include many new antagonists, including May Bennett/Mother Mayhem (Frank Potente) and Jinx (Lisa Ambalavanar). Furthermore, this season will only include 12 episodes, a departure from the series customary 13-episode seasons. If the trailer is to be believed, Lex Luthor will be the season’s new villain. Titans season 4 part 1 will launch with two episodes on HBO Max on Thursday, November 3. The program will continue to release one episode every week until the end of December. Six episodes will comprise the first part of the superhero program. The remaining six episodes of the season will air sometime in 2023.</p><h2>Titans season 4 trailer: A new villain and a slew of fresh plotlines</h2><p>The series has always astounded DC fans with its daring and unusual depiction of the Teen Titans. Be it Nightwing’s (Brenton Thwaites) stories or Conner Kent, alias Superboy (Joshua Orpin), the series seems to be strong to the core.&nbsp;In that aspect, the upcoming season should not disappoint. The teaser for the forthcoming season teases a lot of mystical themes, as well as some fantastic new characters that will put our young superheroes to the test. The new season’s summary is as follows:</p><p>“After saving Gotham, the Titans took the road to return to San Francisco. However, after a brief stay in Metropolis, they find themselves in the crosshairs of a superhuman group with abilities, unlike anything they’ve ever encountered. Titans Season 4, Part 1 launches on HBO Max on November 3rd.”</p><p>There will also be some significant occurrences between Superboy and Lex Luthor, whose DNA was used to create Superboy and will appear in the first episode. The first episode is named Lex Luthor, continuing a Titans tradition. It will begin with Mother Mayhem, the title of the second episode. Jinx, Super Super Mart, Inside Man, and Brother Blood are the remaining four episodes slated for release this year.</p><p>According to speculations surrounding the show’s most recent season, Superman may also feature in this one. That’ll be some story development, particularly since Luthor is now in command of the villain role.</p><p>Brenton Thwaites portrays Dick Grayson, Anna Diop portrays Kory Anders, Teagan Croft portrays Rachel Roth, Ryan Potter portrays Gar Logan, Curran Walters portrays Jason Todd, Alan Ritchson portrays Hank Hall, Minka Kelly portrays Dawn Granger, Chelsea Zhang portrays Rose Wilson, and Joshua Orpin portrays Conner.&nbsp;The first half of the show’s fourth season will end on HBO Max on December 1, 2022.
