So far, so normal.</p><p>After heading through the usual check-in procedure to make sure I knew I was taking my life in my own hands going around the course, I was off to the standby gate where I waited to start my heat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2w8a0504-41a3ec537e85a51fcf255bef0a33e157.jpg><p>Looking around, there was a lot more of a mix of participants than your usual obstacle races.</p><p>The 5k is not just for the steely-eyed maniacs who are a regular feature at the longer events; there were plenty of people attending who looked like they’d turned up for a regular jog in the park, which in effect, they had.</p><p>A quick warm-up and safety talk followed before taking the Tough Mudder pledge, explaining that these events aren’t races, but opportunities to tackle some adversity as a group.</p><p>It’s a nice sentiment I thought, as me and my race partner dashed to the front of the pack, determined not to be overtaken by anyone else running in our heat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hero-walls-herowalls_620_r_00127-290aedb9629acf8a8b1c22f1500b97c9.jpg><p>We got glorious sunshine for our event, which definitely helped the festival atmosphere, and I was grateful we had avoided a steady drizzle which would have taken some of the gloss off the day.</p><p>Before long we started hitting the obstacles, which are the usual combination of high fences to jump over, nets to crawl under and monkey bars to swing beneath.</p><p>If you’re 5'10" or above and can do a chin-up, you’ll probably manage most of what’s thrown your way relatively comfortably.</p><p>Below that and the teamwork starts to kick in, and you’ll be helping your fellow runners scramble over the high fences and get a helpful boost from other people in your heat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2w8a0598-588c65bba4fa91b42b99aafe741bb3d6.jpg><p>Either way, you shouldn’t take much more than a hour to get the course done, even if you struggle with a couple of the obstacles.</p><p>From what I saw, people are very willing to give each other a hand when the going gets tough, and it’s a much less competitive environment that some of the other events around.</p><p>After what felt like not very much time at all, we’d clambered around the final section of the course and we were rewarded with our finishers t-shirts and post-race pints.</p><p>I felt a little underwhelmed when we were done, mostly because I wasn’t wet, muddy and gasping for air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pyramid_606_s_00258-9644e7056e8d7cdab8c73c13dc3e286a.jpg><p>But actually, if you’re willing to not take it too seriously and you run the course as a group, it’s a lot more fun than a standard Tough Mudder race - if a little less rewarding.</p><p>There’s no water/mud-based obstacles in the 5k events, which means once you’re finished, you can comfortably chill in the sunshine with a few post-race bevvies and a burger from one of the food stalls.</p><p>Tickets for the events are around £39 depending on when you sign up - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>find them here</strong></a> - which is a little steep in my book, especially when you can do a half Tough Mudder for £59.</p><p>But if you’ve got a mixed-ability group of friends, or you’re looking for an ideal team-building activity, the 5k race would be a pretty good shout.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfa4B3g49pcGisn6q0qXnMrpudnaJigqx50Z6top2nZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rowing-blazers.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Rowing Blazers net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
