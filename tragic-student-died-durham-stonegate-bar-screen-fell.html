and also failed to properly assess risks, used inappropriate equipment and ignored danger signs.</p><p>He said Missoula, in the city's Walkergate precinct, had two entrances, and the lower rear one was where Ms Burt was queuing to get in to the busy Wednesday night Game Over event, popular with <a href=#>university</a> <a href=#>sports</a> teams.</p><p>Ms Burt, from Milford on Sea in <a href=#>Hampshire</a>, was a member of the Sailing Club.</p><p>Social secretaries of the various sports teams would distribute wristbands to members so they could queue-jump at the back entrance, Mr Hill said.</p><p>Door staff were supplied by an external company.</p><p>Mr Hill said there was "some criticism" of the way they managed the queues, but the legal responsibility for health and safety remained with the pub company.</p><p>CCTV footage showed queues building up in the precinct after 11pm as the venue filled towards its capacity of 630, the court heard.</p><p>Mr Hill said: "For at least 12 months, when queues formed, students were asked to stand along the side of the decorative screen.</p><p>"Nobody from Stonegate had carried out any specific risk assessment of this measure.</p><p>"Nobody from the club had turned their mind to the dangers."</p><p>A nightclub queue was different from that of a <a href=#>museum</a>, he said, with some people having had a <a href=#>drink</a> - and at times there would be pushing and shoving, "but nothing like a <a href=#>football</a> crowd".</p><p>"We say that by bringing the decorative screen into use to direct and order the queue to the back door, the club were using it for a purpose for which it was entirely unsuitable," he added.</p><p>"Any kind of risk assessment would have made the company realise that the screen could be pushed over and someone may well be injured."</p><p>Although the decorative screen was not suitable for crowd management, it was "nevertheless heavy", Mr Hill said.</p><p>He told the court it had toppled over about half-an-hour before Ms Burt's death, taking four people to lift it back into place.</p><p>Two panels had come off it and the structure which was "already unfit for the purpose of crowd management had been further weakened", Mr Hill said.</p><p>This earlier collapse of the screen was an "important missed opportunity", the prosecution said, and students should have been moved away from it.</p><p>Mr Hill said: "By re-erecting that barrier, and allowing the queuing to continue, we say they allowed the conditions leading to Olivia's death to persist."</p><p>Ms Burt and her friends arrived after the first screen collapse and were unaware it had happened.</p><p>Between 11.30pm and 12midnight, the venue was full and large numbers of people were waiting to get in, Mr Hill said.</p><p>"Part of the queue was lined up next to the decorative screen, and some students were leaning against it.</p><p>"There was a holding area for others arriving, but those numbers were continuing to grow."</p><p>At 11.48pm, the decorative screen gave way again, the court heard.</p><p>Mr Hill said: "Olivia fell through the panels, the screen went over, others fell and tragically Olivia died despite the attempts of initially students, door staff and then paramedics, nothing could be done.</p><p>"She had suffered a devastating head injury."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He said: "The prosecution says the fatal accident was foreseeable, predictable and preventable."</p><p>The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/23e89706-0678-4ad4-84ba-10d70fcfae5e.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fdb92b27-0917-4d8c-a104-e3b74285167b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6727e2fd-35c9-4034-9a39-81494e5b10c8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2609280a-bf45-4c2e-be58-f609d57764bf.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2018-firm-denies-four-breaches-826147518.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ394gZRpZ2lnpKeuqLXCZqqtrZSau7V5w6KcnWWUqr%2Bprcxmqq2nnpq0osDEZpmaql2osLOxxKdkn52coXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./odell-beckham-jr-and-lauren-woods-family-photos-with-son-zydn.html><span>←</span><span>Odell Beckham Jr. and Lauren Wood's Family Photos With Son Zydn</span></a>
