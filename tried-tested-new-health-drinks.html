In terms of health benefits, blueberries are packed full of vitamin C, aronia berries are considered one of the richest sources of plant antioxidants and juniper extract has been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal and autoimmune disorders</p><p>This juice blend contains just 4.6g sugar and 20 calories per 100ml. £2.25 for a 1-litre carton, see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">theberrycompany.co.uk</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/8d9faa42-c332-4350-b516-cc783659f805.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Gut health</h2><p>AFTER 150 years, malted-milk drink firm Horlicks is joining the world of protein products.</p><p>Protein, as we know, is good for gym bunnies but is also key to preventing muscle loss as we age.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Its Healthy Gut drink is specially formulated with Vitamins B12, B6, C and D to contribute to the function of the immune system.</p><p>It also contains prebiotics and the amino acid glutamine, which is great for immune function – especially if you are stressed.</p><p>You add hot or cold milk to make a drink and it tastes great, just like the original with that familiar malted milk. Gorgeous.</p><p>Watch the calories though – 271 calories per 40g serving with 300ml semi skimmed milk, 17.7g sugar and 15.4g protein.</p><p>£14.99 for a 400g pouch, see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">horlicks.co.uk</a> and Amazon.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Plant milk</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3ea947d5-6d1c-4ad6-83da-9ebacd3d2051.jpg><p>I LIKE milk. The normal stuff, from the cow. And I do struggle with the alternatives.</p><p>But this one is good. Lilk’s Common Blend is a combination of five per cent oats and five per cent rice, with water, rapeseed oil, calcium, stabilisers and vitamins.</p><p>It was designed to be used in tea and coffee, which is probably why I like it.</p><p>Many of the plant milks I’ve tried in the past can ruin a good cuppa.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>The genius apparently is in the mixing of the oats and rice.
