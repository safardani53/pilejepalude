Until she saw the ring.</p><p>It seemed to her that he had not consulted her actual jewelry collection, her friends, her family, or even looked at anything related to jewelry before picking something out. She describes it as shaped like a heart and made from dark amber‚Äîamber is actually a difficult stone to wear everyday, because it's fairly soft and wears down. Diamonds are pretty ridiculous, but they're very hard, and won't get dinged by every day use. The OP wasn't sure how to talk to her fianc√© about any of this without hurting his feelings and was looking for advice. Was she being shallow?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Some readers thought maybe (the post's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comments</a> still exist, if not her original words), until they actually saw a picture of the thing:</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Wow.
