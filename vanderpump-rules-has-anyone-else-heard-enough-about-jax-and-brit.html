fresh air in the Bravo lineup.</p><p>Amid all the manufactured feuds between middle-aged one-percenters, here was a series about a group of struggling young people in the all-too relatable position of

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>These days, however, the show is a different animal entirely.</p><p>One cast member has already reached the big 4-0, and the milestone is on the not-too-distanct horizon for several others.</p><p>Gone are the days of struggling to make ends meet at SUR and bickering over sexual liaisons.</p><p>Now, the cast argues about real estate prices and party-planning SNAFUs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-pic-683x1024.jpg><p>We’re not shaming them for finding success, and we’re certainly not shaming them for getting older.</p><p>One is an admirable accomplishment, and the other happens to all of us.</p><p>But recent episodes have made it clear that the drama that made the show famous will be increasingly scarce from here on out, and the last-second addition of some fresh-faced cast members isn’t doing much to ameliorate the problem.</p><p>Anyway, party-planning drama is what we have, so party-planning drama is what we’ll talk about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Last week, it was <a href=#>Stassi’s book signing at TomTom</a>, and we imagine there were some people who were hoping that nothingburger would be a source of conflict for the rest of the season?</p><p>Well, we’ve got good news for both of you!</p><p>Tom Sandoval is still super jelly about his castmate’s success and is still sacrificing his "nice guy" title by being a flat-out douche-nozzle about the whole thing.</p><p>You almost hope this conflict is scripted, because if it’s not, Sandoval has some severe emotional issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>What does dude own, like 2.5 percent of TomTom?</p><p>Coincidentally, that’s the percentage of his soul that isn’t burning with jealousy over Stassi’s success.</p><p>This week, of course, the gang was in Miami for Jax and Brittany’s bachelorette exarvaganza, so most of the party planning drama had to do with <a href=#>Jax and Brittany’s wedding</a>.</p><p>In case you were wondering, yes, that’s going to be the central theme of every episode this season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Naturally, the guys went to strip club, where Jax went full creepy middle-aged guy on some strippers half his age.</p><p>Meanwhile, the girls danced in tacky wedding dresses at a pair of South Beach clubs.</p><p>At the second loacation, the staff brought out a sign that read, "Don’t do it, Brittany!" which is clearly their standard joke for bachelorette parties.</p><p>Sh-tfaced beyond reckoning, Brittany went into tantrum mode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I hear it every f–king day, people telling me that they don’t like me, they don’t like Jax, they don’t like us together," she ranted.</p><p>"So the last thing I wanted was to come on my bachelorette party and have to go out and [see] a f–king sign saying, ‘Don’t do it, Brittany!’"</p><p>Yes, this is an entire storyline about Brittany drunkenly overreacting to a joke.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out a couple things here:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>1. <a href=#>Jax cheated on Brittany</a> like a few months before he proposed, so a lot of people are gonna think he’s a creep because of his past.</p><p>2. During Brit’s signage meltdown, Jax was neck-deep in strippers, so a lot of people are gonna think he’s a creep because he still is.</p><p>And that, folks, is what Vanderpump Rules is offering in its wildly unnecessary eighth season.</p><p>But hey, at least we got to see Beau Clark remind Tom Sandoval that he sucks.</p><p>Oh, and no James Kennedy — bonus!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Vanderpump Rules Season 8 Preview: Stassi & Kristen Flat-Out Hate Each Other!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2V%2BcMLAp5ueqqCqurF50a6jnqtdna60ecCnsKimlWKyrb%2FEZp%2BemaKZeqa6zq6eoWWRl7y2wIyjmLFlkaOxbq7Roqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./former-msnbc-news-anchor-monica-novotny-and-her-husband-michael-foley-happily-married.html><span>←</span><span>Former MSNBC news anchor Monica Novotny and her husband Michael Foley happily married</span></a>
