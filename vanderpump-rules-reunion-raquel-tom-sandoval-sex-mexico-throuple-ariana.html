In the last five minutes of the episode,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a> did an interview with production six days after the reunion filmed, and revealed more details about her affair with <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tom Sandoval</a> </strong>that no one else knew besides them. Raquel revealed that the second time she had sex with Sandoval was in Mexico for <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a>‘s wedding, when she also made out with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I was like we can’t see each other. This isn’t gonna be a thing,” Raquel recalled of her and Sandoval’s dynamic heading into the Mexico trip. “But then that first night in Cancun, he was drunk and was trying to find his room. And I heard him talking in the hallway. There was somebody working there and he was asking which direction the elevator was. I was like, ‘Wait, just come inside.’ I was like, ‘Sorry sir.’ He was really drunk. That was the second time that we were physical and intimate with each other.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Raquel confirmed to production that she and Sandoval had sex “multiple times” in Mexico, and that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the affair</a> became “a regular thing” after that. “I don’t remember how often it would happen, but it definitely picked up speed more after we wrapped filming,” she confessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Raquel-Leviss-Tom-Sandoval-Ariana-Madix-bravo-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Production asked Raquel if she’s spent time with Sandoval’s family, and she confirmed that she met his mother in Los Angeles. “She was aware of the situation,” Raquel claimed. Raquel tried denying that she went with Sandoval to his home city of St. Louis, despite there being photo proof they were together there. “I have a really bad poker face,” Raquel said with a laugh, before she admitted, “It freaking happened. Yeah.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I definitely felt really guilty,” Raquel also said, explaining that “a huge part of her” wanted to inform <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ariana Madix</strong> </a>about the affair. “It ate me alive not to tell her,” Raquel said. “I even suggested…I was like what would Ariana think about like having me as an addition. He was like, ‘No, no no. She would not be into that.’ ” Raquel confirmed she wanted a “throuple” with Sandoval and Ariana, and said, “I love Ariana as a person. And then also I’m in love with Tom Sandoval. So yeah it didn’t seem like that far-fetched of an idea. But it was not something in question. God, he’s gonna kill me. I just hate lying so much. I hate it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Raquel-Leviss-Tom-Sandoval-Ariana-Madix-ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Raquel initially would not disclose if she had sex with Sandoval in the jacuzzi when Ariana was away for her grandmother’s funeral. “He’s asked me to not disclose all this information,” she told production. “Especially now with being so isolated. I feel like Tom is my one person that I do have. If I just went and betrayed him, then I’d really have nobody.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Raquel started getting emotional about <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lying about the affair</a> with Tom. “This is the one story that we’ve agreed on getting straight,” she said. “I know that the reason that Tom wanted to lie about it is because it’s a really bad look to hook up with someone’s boyfriend in their own house when they’ve gone out of town. Especially for a funeral of all things. So I don’t know. This kills my soul. I am so sick of lying. I hate it. I hate being deceitful. It’s horrible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Raquel-Leviss-Tom-Sandoval-Vanderpump-Rules-Reunion-bravo-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Alex Baskin first teased that something shocking would happen at the end of the&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;finale in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>&nbsp;on May 17. He explained that the cast didn’t jump right into filming <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 11</a> because <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“new information”</a> was revealed at the reunion. “I will put it this way: There are revelations, and they are revelations that not all of them know now,” Alex said in the interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Alex reiterated that a “twist” was coming to the show in a June 6 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and confirmed that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the Scandoval timeline</a> “evolves” with the new information. “It isn’t something the group witnessed at the time,” Alex said about the big reveal. “So I think they’re going to have to respond to it when they see it.” He also debunked the rumors that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Raquel is pregnant</a> and that Raquel and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a> slept together, in the&nbsp;THR&nbsp;interview, which came out the day before the reunion finale.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Tom and Raquel <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly broke up</a> less than two months after they were caught having an affair behind Ariana’s back. Tom has been <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>out and about on his tour</a> with his band since then. In April, Raquel<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> entered a mental health treatment</a> center in Arizona as she continued to work on her “<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>patterns of codependency</a> and addiction to being and feeling loved.” Meanwhile, Ariana has been getting by with the<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> support of her friends</a>, including her co-stars <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scheana Shay</strong>,</a> <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>James Kennedy</strong>.</a> She’s moved on from Tom with her new boyfriend <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Daniel Wai</strong></a>, who she met at a wedding after finding out about the affair.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The cast is currently on an extended filming break as producers create a plan for<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Season 11 of Vanderpump Rules</a>. While several cast members, including Ariana, have <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said they don’t want to film</a> with Tom and Raquel, but Alex told&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;that “the cast knows that those conditional demands never work.” As for when the show will pick up filming again, Alex said, “Our hope and plan is in the not-too-distant future this summer. So, in the next few weeks.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e49wZq%2BZnpmys7zUpqdmqqWhsrR50Z6sp6Gfo3qzrdCunKVlpKS6br%2FAp5uorpGherSx12aknrCZmLxuwMerpq6onJp6or7ImqWaZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mary-beth-evans-19610307-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mary Beth Evans (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
