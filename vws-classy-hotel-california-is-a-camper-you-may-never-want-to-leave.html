Being woken up through the night by some tween experimenting with legal highs and Strongbow trying to climb inside my tent is no fun.</p><p>Never again, I vowed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/images2Foriginal2F12300-VolkswagenCaliforniaOcean-e1536681817571.jpg><p>But it doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy a festival — there are more grown-up ways to enjoy a three-day bender in a field.</p><p>The VW California has been in production since 1988 and in that time it has become a legend of nomadic culture.</p><p>Whether you are on a family tour of Scotland or you need a place to keep beers cold at a festival, the “Hotel California” is an ideal wagon.</p><p>Now on the T6 generation, the California will sleep four at a push.</p><p>Grown-ups can take the roomy pop-up canopy, which unfolds at the push of a button, and the kids can sleep on the collapsed rear seats.</p><p>It can be specced with a gas stove and comes with a fridge deep enough for a week’s food — or enough Red Stripe to cause permanent memory loss.</p><p>And it’s got the all-important heating system which runs without the engine on.</p><p>To test the California, I treated the wife to Standon Calling festival — a four-day party set against the stunning backdrop of the Hertfordshire countryside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/images2Foriginal2F11879-ThenewVolkswagenCalifornia.jpg><p>Unlike the sprawling canvas favelas of Glastonbury, Standon Calling is compact enough to get your bearings, but large enough to stay entertained over a long weekend.</p><p>It’s free of drugged-up teenagers screaming their way through bad comedowns and is packed with like-minded folk enjoying bands and a few drinks in the sunshine.</p><p>This year’s headliners included Bryan Ferry, Paloma Faith and man-of-the-moment George Ezra. But there are thousands of acts to see, as well as loads of things to do with the children.</p><p>I was worried I had packed the van’s fridge entirely with booze — the missus won’t live on Pot Noodles alone — but I needn’t have stressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425317840.jpg><p>Standon Calling is what the middle classes call a “foodie festival”.</p><p>One of the biggest advantages of taking the California was the class of neighbour.</p><p>The entire site was buzzing with fellow vanners — all friendly and helpful to a van virgin like me.</p><p>Our plot was next to a fantastic family of five, Colin and Hannah and their kids Bea, Lottie and Caspar, who would pop over and offer a coffee each morning when we stumbled from the van, bodies buckled from the hangover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/images2Foriginal2F18084-VW8719-e1536684572539.jpg><p>My “dream garage” list is already long, but the California has just been added to it.</p><p>Yes, it costs north of £46k, but think of the money you will save on hotel bills.</p><p>It’s as easy to drive as a car, which means renting one, for around £700 a week, isn’t intimidating.</p><p>And if you fancy taking one to a festival, look out for me. I will even give you one of my Red Stripes.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>VW Camper flipped on its side and turned into crazy 100mph race car</span><ul><li>Standon Calling will be back next year, from July 25-28.

But if you are in the market for a hard-as-nails AWD family motor that can cope with any terrain and tow a caravan, this is the car.</p><p>Already a firm favourite with country types, the 2018 Outback has been tweaked to broaden its appeal. The brittle suspension has been softened and the steering given more weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425709701-e1534005378781.jpg><p>I would be lying if I said it is now a fun car to drive but it is impressive for other reasons.</p><p>Subaru’s AWD system is possibly the best in the world.</p><p>It is hard to imagine the snow storms we endured last winter in this heat wave but the chances are they will be back – and when winter comes, I want an Outback.</p><p>Hill descent and X-Mode come as standard. In X-Mode the Outback becomes an off-road ninja, tempering the braking, AWD, throttle map and gearing to negotiate low traction terrain.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Jeremy Clarkson struggles to herd sheep in a Subaru and more in trailer for Episode 5 of Season 2 of The Grand Tour</span><p>There is decent ground clearance but a relatively low driving position.</p><p>The boot is now a cavernous 559 litres and the rears seats fold more or less flat.</p><p>It will tow up to 2,000kg, which is pick-up truck-worthy and more than you’re likely to ever need.</p><p>The thing you won’t love about it is the CVT gearbox. We just have to accept that this is the route Subaru is going down, but it’s annoying.</p><p>You can choose from just two trim levels and one 2.5-litre petrol engine.

Some critics would argue they are, and that’s why the legendary US brand is having to diversify and release its first adventure bike.</p><p>Others would say Harley is simply keeping up with the times by expanding its portfolio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000423814938-e1534006871649.jpg><p>It’s certainly true that sales are down. Even in the States, where Harley has been king for decades, the market share is dwindling.</p><p>That’s a bigger problem for Harley than any other brand, because selling the bike is just the start of a lucrative relationship with each new customer.</p><p>Harley’s after-sales market is vast, selling endless add-ons and customisation kits for each bike, representing a huge portion of its profit.</p><p>Americans are finally opening their eyes to other manufacturers and different styles of bikes, which is why European brands such as Triumph and BMW are on the up stateside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004254884271-e1534006936903.jpg><p>And then there’s the very public spat with Donald Trump, after the president blasted the firm for moving some of its operations out of the US.</p><p>And Trump is a hero to much of the Harley-riding community.</p><p>It all means Harley-Davidson has decided to take drastic action.</p><p>The adventure bike is just the start. As part of a billion-dollar commitment to making new models, the face of Harley is changing fast, and for good.</p><p>Everything from electric bikes, commuter tools and learner-friendly machines will join the HD range over the next few years. Most of the excitement, though, surrounds the adventure bike.</p><p>You can see why – it’s a peach.</p><p>Technical specs are thin on the ground, but you can trust it will be at the heavier, more expensive end of the range.</p><p>Harley is also promising a new cruiser and a stripped-back street fighter model.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN MOTORS</h2></p><p>At Bike World we are looking forward to riding them all, especially following the success of the new Softail range.</p><p>That said, we can’t help but remember Buell, the street bike brand founded in 1983 by a former Harley engineer, then wholly acquired by Harley in 2003, before it dropped it in 2009.</p><p>Fingers crossed that the light at the end of the tunnel isn’t a V-Rod coming the other way.<br>• For more bikes, search “Bike World” on YouTube or find it on Amazon Prime.</p><p><strong>Alan Rawlings</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHx3hZhsbWtuX6vEtHnCpZisq6litbDAxKVknJmcnrOwvs2imGaho2Kubq%2FApqeeql2uvLZ5zJqwZqaVq7Kzedaapa1lpKR6rbHAr5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlies-angels-photos-actresses-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of The Fierce Ladies Over The Years Hollywood Life</span></a>
