Being on Love Island gives singles the opportunity to couple up and see if they’re compatible with other islanders. But with new people coming in the villa every few days, your potential relationship never seems secure.&nbsp;
Recently, three new people graced the island looking for love. While everyone was pretty much happy with their relationships, some had to be broken."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While everyone was pretty much happy with their relationships, some had to be broken.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>New islander <a href=#>Emily</a> dipped her toes in different waters but found the right temperature with Weston – who was already coupled up with <a href=#>Kelsey</a>. When Kelsey and Weston met, it seemed like love at first sight and Kelsey thought it was going to be a forever thing. However, with Emily in the picture, things got a little shaky.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why happened to Kelsey on Love Island?&nbsp;</h2><p>During the island’s recent re-coupling, Emily coupled up with Weston leaving Kelsey all by herself. Obviously, this broke Kelsey’s heart and she didn’t seem to think this show would be the best opportunity for her to find love. It's because of this that Kelsey decided to remove herself from the island.</p><p>“I came into this villa with an open heart and open mind. I genuinely came in here looking for love and even though I didn’t find that, I met some amazing people along the way,” said Kelsey. “Right now, I think I need to do what’s best for me. So right now, I choose to remove myself from the villa.” &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>However, before Kelsey removed herself, she had to choose if she was going to couple up with any of the islanders. Since she didn’t, three islanders (Eric and Anton) got eliminated.&nbsp;</p><p>While she only had 30 minutes to pack her bags and say her goodbyes, talking to Weston wasn’t in her half-hour itinerary. Weston did try to have a conversation, but Kelsey just chose to keep on moving and expressed that this must’ve been the “right decision for everybody.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What’s next for the departed islander?&nbsp;</h2><p>Only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> can tell. She currently just got her phone back after eliminating herself and just wants to get home, recuperate, and then answer all fan questions. On her Instagram story, she posted, “Hi everyone, it’s Kelsey. I finally just got my phone back so please bear with me. I am trying to respond to everyone. Thank you, everyone, for your support.”</p><p>It seems like Kelsey will be A-OK once she gets back home and hopefully she’ll find someone as committed to her as she was to Weston.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for the remaining islanders, one can’t really get too comfortable. Though a few relationships in the villa seem pretty secure, such as <a href=#>Zac </a>and Elizabeth or Yamen and Aissata, you can’t quite hold your breath when it comes to new connections.&nbsp;</p><p>Every minute counts on Love Island so they’ve got to make the best of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Love Island weeknights on CBS at 8 pm ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSknZyosrp5zqdkpaemmnqqv8uapZ0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trent-frederic-girlfriend-a-look-into-his-parents-relationship-and-dating-history.html><span>←</span><span>Trent Frederic Girlfriend: A Look Into His Parents, Relationship And Dating History</span></a>
