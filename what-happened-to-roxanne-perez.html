Roxanne noted before the fight that she had never trained so hard for a match.</p><p>Her hard work paid off as she defeated Meiko.

Her signature Scorpio Rising Axe Kicks took Roxanne aback. But Roxanne refused to go down.</p><p>In an Instagram post shared before the match, the Texas native expressed how difficult — but also necessary — this fight against Meiko would be.</p><p>Roxanne wrote: "I need this match. I need it to prove to not only you [Meiko], but myself that I can overcome the final boss. I need this match because If I really love this as much as I say I do, if I really want this as much as I say I do, then I am going to have to do everything I can to finally conquer you. I know this battle will be far from easy, but I will keep my NXT Women’s Championship. Because I am the prodigy, and this is my destiny."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Roxanne Perez OK?
