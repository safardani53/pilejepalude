There’s no reason, reason to cry. It was my idea, it wasn’t yours,’” Godejohn claimed. “I … did what I did because I loved her. I really wanted a life with her, I really did.”</p><h2>When Did Nick Godejohn and Gypsy Rose Break Up?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Blanchard and Godejohn met on a Christian dating website in 2012 and met each other in person for the first time in 2015. Upon telling her former boyfriend about her mother, Blanchard and Godejohn met up for the second time that year — the night when he killed Blanchard’s mother.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After he was convicted, Godejohn spoke with Oxygen about his feeling soft Gypsy Rose. Despite the fact that she had moved on by then, Godejohn referred to her as his soul mate.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“From the beginning, I just knew we were soul mates,” Godejohn said. “I was going to get a job and start looking for an apartment after a little ways down the road I’d probably end up marrying her, having children with her. That’s something I never had with someone else. I never ever had it. To this day, she’s the only one that I’ve had that with. … I did feel that she was not taking responsibility for her actions, but at the same time, due to the way I know she was raised, I can’t blame her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahnKudXZ7AbrrInKJmn5%2BZsqu7x6dkp6enYrS6vNKyZKuno5p6o7jAp5qhmaKZwG6x12aZqLGWp7amusNmbGtpZWiDc3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./singer-leann-rimes-visits-bizarre-hq-as-she-prepares-to-drop-her-first-new-song.html><span>←</span><span>Singer LeAnn Rimes visits Bizarre HQ</span></a>
