He closed his fitness studio in Oct. 2016 after 42 years in business, which shocked many.&nbsp;<strong>Dan Taberski</strong> hosts the podcast “Missing Richard Simmons,” which had begun investigating his supposed disappearance from the public eye. He tried to get in touch with Richard’s brother <strong>Lenny</strong> only to have door slammed in his face, but Dan did manage to get Lenny on the phone. “He’s [Richard] not angry with anybody. I don’t understand it,” Lenny said about all the speculation surrounding Richard’s well-being. A friend of Richard’s apparently raised concerns about Richard’s housekeeper on the podcast’s episode last week.</p><h3><a href=#>Richard Simmons — PICS</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Teresa has been working with him for 27 years,” Richard’s rep&nbsp;<strong>Tom Etsey</strong> said in a statement on Tuesday, Mar. 7. “So, holding him hostage is the biggest, I mean…Teresa is a housekeeper, she’s the caretaker, she is extraordinary, she is amazing, she takes impeccable care of Richard and she has for as long as I have been working with Richard. So that is a complete load of crap.” Hopefully everything is okay with Richard and he is just looking to get some privacy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Richard is okay?
