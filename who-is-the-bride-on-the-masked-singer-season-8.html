This week, fans were introduced to three new masked celebrities who competed for a place in the next round. Robin Thicke, Nicole Scherzinger, and Jenny McCarthy returned to the panel as judges. Ken Jeong, who tested positive for Covid-19, was unable to attend the panel this week.</p><p>The Masked Singer replaced him with LEGO Masters star Joel McHale as a judge. They also invited the late actor Leslie Jordan to serve as a panelist. This was Leslie’s last television appearance before his death in October 2022.&nbsp;The Gopher, the Bride, and the Venus Fly Trap were the three new masked superstars that sang their hearts out this week, with the theme Hall of Fame.</p><p>Only one of the three vocalists that performed went to the next round. Finally, after getting the most votes from the judges and impressing them, the Bride was crowned the winner of The Masked Singer season 8 this week.&nbsp;The Bride was never unmasked, but fans believe they know who the celebrity behind the mask is based on the clues that were disclosed. Several fans have speculated that Chris Jericho, a Canadian professional wrestler, would be the Bride of The Masked Singer.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Bride-1.jpg alt="The Bride" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Because of his “raspy voice,” many believe Chris Jericho will be the Bride on The Masked Singer season 8.</h2><p>Fans took to Twitter to say they’re certain it’s Chris Jericho behind the Bride’s mask based on the evidence and his voice. While some fans were skeptical about the identity of the Bride, they quickly jumped on the theory that Jericho was the Bride on The Masked Singer.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Imma just go with the people on this one and say that bride is Chris Jericho since I have no clue 😂 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TheMaskedSinger</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#HallofFameNight</a></p><p>— Gaby 🍂 (@jonahsdove) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 10, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I think the Bride is Chris Jericho from AEW!<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TheMaskedSinger</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/57S31PZM1U</a></p><p>— Kristin (@ColinSearchlig1) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 10, 2022</a></p><h2>The Bride offered the judging panel the following hints before their performance</h2><p>The Bride performed a video montage with hints of their identity before their performance. According to the clue package:</p><p>“We’re all gathered here tonight for Hall of Fame Night, but I promise to rock. I’m usually sharing happy tales, but let me tell you how I got myself here, alone, at this junkyard wedding. I have a tough attitude, I live on the road selling out stadiums, and I like destroying stuff.”</p><p>The bride went on to say:</p><p>“So I’m known for being involved in some of the messiest feuds. I went the solitary road and came here to master. All you ‘Masked Singer’ fans, learn a new commitment. So, the bride arrives tonight!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Bride-2.jpg alt="The Bride" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A globe with a crown, a rose, a rock and roll hand symbol, a guy wearing two pins, a musical note sign, and a snake were among the visual clues in their video montage. The Bride sang Shut Up and Dance by Walk the Moon during their performance. The onstage hint for the Bride was the words ‘Action Hero,’ and the contestant said that they are a “take-action” bride who doesn’t mind being the “hero,” among other things.&nbsp;Whitesnake, Steven Seagal, Carrot Top, or David Coverdale were among the judges’ predictions. The Bride has gone to the next round, so fans will have to wait and see whether their predictions were correct.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>The Bride</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>The Masked Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZJuqmZmybrvNZquhnV2irrS3xJ1krKGenLKzedKemKynnmKFcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sky-sports-presenter-melissa-reddy.html><span>←</span><span>Sky Sports presenter Melissa Reddy stuns in low-cut top as fans call her sexiest lady on the plan</span></a>
