He bought every single thing that I sent him. He was pretty much a follower from the beginning," she explained, adding that they would talk everyday and he even made custom requests.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Within two months' time, Tai said this follower had shelled out approximately $2,000 AUD on her content. She explained that she didn't know who the user was, but he had a very specific username.</p><p>So when she saw someone with this exact username view her TikTok page, she did a little investigating. Weirdly enough, TikTok marked this person's profile as someone she had in her phone contacts.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Tai narrowed it down to about six people who it could be, one of which included her stepfather. To confirm her suspicion, she messaged the account and wrote that she knew who they were.</p><p>"Within two minutes, I got a text from my stepdad which said, "Hey Tai, can we talk?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Tai informed him that she would be telling her mom immediately. As she phoned her mom, he asked to speak with her. Finally, Tai accepted his call and they discussed this, with her mom listening on a different line.</p><p>Her stepdad claimed that he had only subscribed to her page "for her welfare." When he got home later that day, Tai's mom told him to pack her bags. It was over.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Users in the comments were thrilled to hear that Tai's mom had her back and ended things with her stepdad right away.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, it seems like the trauma will haunt Tai forever. She explained that at one point, her stepdad had sent her a picture of his genitals and asked her to rate it. Another time, he requested she film a video for him of her having sex with her partner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc2sZKyslaWxorCMn6alpJ%2BswG60xKtkqKacrrOiutI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sea-hear-now-2022-buy-tickets.html><span>←</span><span>Sea.Hear.Now 2022: How can I buy tickets?</span></a>
