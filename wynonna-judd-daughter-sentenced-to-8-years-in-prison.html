But, given her history, it is unclear if she is likely to be paroled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>According to RadarOnline, <a href=#>Grace was arrested</a> for leaving a court-mandated drug recovery program early.</p><p>The premature departure was a violation of her parole.</p><p>The order for her arrest was issued in November of 2017.</p><p>This stems from months earlier, in May of 2017, when Grace pleaded guilty to&nbsp;meth manufacture, delivery, sale, and possession with intent in&nbsp;Williamson County Court.</p><p>In addition, Grace was also charged with the manufacture and delivery of methamphetamines in the neighboring Maury County.</p><p>In that case, Grace pleaded guilty to the lesser charge — possession of meth.</p><p>Grace had been ordered to serve&nbsp;11 months and 29 days in prison, but was instead gifted with a suspended sentence.</p><p>She had an enviable opportunity — to serve her sentence on probation after spending only 30 days behind bars and then 180 days in an in-house rehab program.</p><p>Unfortunately, it appears that Gracd squandered her parole and will instead spend a great deal of time behind bars. At the earliest, she will still serve for months and months.</p><p>She was also ordered to pay a fine of $3,092.50. Given that her balance due is now reportedly $3,273.50, it appears that she has not attempted to resolve that.</p><p>This past year or so is not Grace Pauline Kelley’s first time running into trouble with the law.</p><p>In December of 2015, she was arrested in the parking lot of a Walgreens in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>Months later, she was charged with&nbsp;promotion of meth manufacture.</p><p>She was able to plead guilty to the lesser charge of possession of meth, but that’s still … not great. In fact, it’s genuinely worrisome.</p><p>She was also arrested in Alabama as a “fugitive from justice.”</p><p>Many people read this story with confusion, wondering how this could have happened.</p><p>Wynonna Judd has a net worth of about $20 million. They wonder how she could fail to help her daughter.</p><p>We don’t know the ins and outs of this family, but we know that family life can be complicated. Sometimes, people take a while before they’re prepared to actually accept help.</p><p>If Grace is an addict, which some might infer from her criminal history, then there may be some major trust issues between mother and daughter that make it difficult for Wynonna to help. Addicts lie.</p><p>Some wonder if Wynonna has simply cut off contact with her young adult daughter in response to this criminal behavior and perhaps as a result of past misdeeds related to meth, but that is all speculation.</p><p>We hope that, perhaps behind bars, Grace can get the help that she clearly needs.</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>23 Celebs Who Did Time Behind Bars</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WDcMPYp6anppFit7aww2abmq2XncGmvoysnKeslaOwprCMraZmcF2usqK%2B0magp2Wgp7a0u81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-valuable-half-dollar-coins-2.html><span>←</span><span>Most valuable half dollar coins revealed - do you have any in your spare change?</span></a>
